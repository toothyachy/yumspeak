But this is definitely one of the worst experience I\u2019ve had. Waitress was so rude. My mother asked for a certain dish and instead of replying verbally, the rude waitress simply gestured with her palm (a nonchalant wave as if waving goodbye lol) with her mouth chewing something or what?? Secondly, the moment we ordered our 4th dish, she proceeded to keep ALL our menus WHILST my parents were still looking. I asked her why the rush? She told me \u201coh usually 3 paxes don\u2019t order beyond 4 dishes\u201d hello? That\u2019s according to your subjective experiences so far, do not generalize? Thirdly, I asked for 4 bowls of rice and she totally (acted or not idk) gave me a stunned look and then proceeds to reply me in a condescending tone. Cmon I was wearing a sports jersey, I\u2019m tanned, I clearly do sports can\u2019t you see? Was it necessary to react that way? Even if she can\u2019t tell, it definitely was not POLITE to question customers unnecessarily. Seriously smh at the horrible service. Lastly, while eating she even came by our table and asked hypocritically if we needed to order more? Obviously no, because the food was nothing to rave about\ud83e\udd2d Nothing but lackluster. Nobody is expecting a 5 star service here, but instead the least one can provide is basic courtesy and mutual respect. Side note: the other staffs here are OK, delivering what they should and nothing more. So there\u2019s none to pick on.",

Verbally told waitress of order, food came, after eating we ate paid at the counter. The noodle and rice dishes are approx $6 to $8. The zichar dishes are from $10. The steamboat fishhead starts from $28. Very decent place for aircon, free parking and flavourful food in Bukit Timah. The shops in Turf City are moving out by the end of 2023 as SLA did not renew the master tenants lease after its expiry in end 2023.",

We queued and asked if can make reservations, and was told cant as already full and asked to look for own tables. We waited for about 20-25mins and saw patrons of a table leaving and went over to the table and wanted to sit down as they stood up. A staff came over and said the table was for customers seated at next smaller table who had 5 pax. I was unhappy and told that your staff told us to look for own table. Now I found one, and was told they reserved for customers seated at next table who had 5 pax. And well, we had 5 of us too!! And they kept arguing that that group came first and 5 pax cant fit that table they were at, and asked 5 of us to sit on that smaller table! If that table cant fit that group with 5 pax, then why can it fit 5 of us then?? And please, do not ask customers to look for own table then since youve pre-arranged seating for your other customers!!",

But this is definitely one of the worst experience I ve had. Waitress was so rude. My mother asked for a certain dish and instead of replying verbally, the rude waitress simply gestured with her palm (a nonchalant wave as if waving goodbye lol) with her mouth chewing something or what?? Secondly, the moment we ordered our 4th dish, she proceeded to keep ALL our menus WHILST my parents were still looking. I asked her why the rush? She told me  oh usually 3 paxes don t order beyond 4 dishes  hello? That s according to your subjective experiences so far, do not generalize? Thirdly, I asked for 4 bowls of rice and she totally (acted or not idk) gave me a stunned look and then proceeds to reply me in a condescending tone. Cmon I was wearing a sports jersey, I m tanned, I clearly do sports can t you see? Was it necessary to react that way? Even if she can t tell, it definitely was not POLITE to question customers unnecessarily. Seriously smh at the horrible service. Lastly, while eating she even came by our table and asked hypocritically if we needed to order more? Obviously no, because the food was nothing to rave about  Nothing but lackluster. Nobody is expecting a 5 star service here, but instead the least one can provide is basic courtesy and mutual respect. Side note: the other staffs here are OK, delivering what they should and nothing more. So there s none to pick on.",
