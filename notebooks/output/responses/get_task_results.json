Surprisingly does not come with cylinder tteok which you have to add on, but I did throughly enjoy the noodle shaped rice cakes, which were soft and super chewy! It was very delicious and satisfied my tteokbokki cravings. You can add on other ingredients or types of rice cakes (like sweet potato tteok!) I recommend adding sliced cheese \ud83e\uddc0 hehe. The fried fish cake was really tasty and had the perfect crunchy yet chewy texture \ud83e\udee8\ud83e\udd79\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4d Really liked it!!\n\n\u2764\ufe0f Mul Naengmyeon\nThe arrowhead noodles were thin, super cold and chilly, with nice tangy flavour. Pretty good!\n\nThe place is really cozy and feels like you\u2019re in a pojangmacha in korea! Definitely a fun experience and atmosphere.\nOverall, would recommend their tteokbokki! I want to try their croffles and tteokbokki hotpot next time..\n\nfood 5/5\nservice 5/5 (food served quickly, nice and hot!)\nambience 5/5",

What I tried: Mini Plain (added cheese) This came with glass noodles, half a fully boiled egg, noodle tteok, one fried mandu, vegetables and a fried fish cake. Surprisingly does not come with cylinder tteok which you have to add on, but I did throughly enjoy the noodle shaped rice cakes, which were soft and super chewy! It was very delicious and satisfied my tteokbokki cravings. You can add on other ingredients or types of rice cakes (like sweet potato tteok!) I recommend adding sliced cheese   hehe. The fried fish cake was really tasty and had the perfect crunchy yet chewy texture        Really liked it!! Mul Naengmyeon The arrowhead noodles were thin, super cold and chilly, with nice tangy flavour. Pretty good! The place is really cozy and feels like you re in a pojangmacha in korea! Definitely a fun experience and atmosphere. Overall, would recommend their tteokbokki! I want to try their croffles and tteokbokki hotpot next time.. food 5/5 service 5/5 (food served quickly, nice and hot!) ambience 5/5",

The sticky rice cakes, which are basically what I was there for, are way too soft and not chewy and overcooked. They didn t even have chili so I just had to swallow bland tasteless rice paste (not chewy enough to be called rice cakes) by itself. Especially given how many truly great Korean restaurants you have in the same neighbourhood, I would not recommend this one in good conscience",

Especially when compared to normal Korean restaurants this is too small. Ordered the TBK stew it was average. Also, probably the first Korean restaurant that DOES NOT serve free water or ban chan (sides). Honestly if the prices are typical Korean charges but the food are smaller in portion with the lack of frills provided then it s really nothing to shout about. Unlikely to return. Many better Korean restaurants to visit nearby",

Chicken was quite disappointing for me because it seems to be frozen chicken bites and was quite fatty. My favourite was the flying fish roe rice which was really delicious! But could probably be replicated pretty easily at home haha. Had higher expectations and meal was not cheap, so 3/5",

There was a bit of a smell at Chadol, but the quality of the meat was the same at Korean tteokbokki restaurants, so it didnt really matter. Although it looked delicious in the photo, I was really disappointed and just ate it without saying anything. In Korea, you can eat delicious and spicy Sinjeon Tteokbokki for 3,500 won, but here you dont even order anything and it doesnt taste that good, but it costs 67,000 won. It might be better to just buy the ingredients and cook it at home. When I saw the butter garlic fries, I thought of a youth caf\u00e9 and ordered it right away!! So the moment I take a bite, huh..? How is this butter garlic? Its not the butter garlic fries we imagined, but the fries are a little dry, the sauce tastes like mustard, and theres garlic in between. Its a waste of money. Just go to McDonalds and get the fries. I went there thinking it would be better than two meals, but if you just go for two meals with unlimited refills, I recommend it because you can adjust the seasoning and eat as much as you want. Im really sorry, but I was very disappointed.",

Everything Looks Yummy On Their Menu & Their Food Quality & Servings Are Better Than e Others I Would Say...     Their Added Cheese Are Superb Especially If You Are A Cheesy Lover Like Me   However Their Toppoki Are Not As Chewy As What Ive Tried So Far From A Few Other Korean Restaurants... But Still... Ill Give Them A Higher Rating Coz Their Staff Service Are Excellent Too Whether On e Warmth Welcome, Approached Or Recommendations On Food Choices   Ill Definitely Be Back Again To Try Some Other Food On Their Menu Soon...

Staff were rather friendly and helpful, would probably give this place another go if we re in the area, considering how crowded it can get especially on the weekend! :)",

It was all right but a little too soupy and far too sweet for me. Otherwise, it was okay. We also tried the seaweed rolls, which were okay. If you want water, you have to buy a bottle for $2. Not the end of the world but I felt like tap water ought to be on offer. Service was decent. The two people working out front when we went were both Korean, so no communication issues. They were friendly and helpful. They have a one-hour time limit on seating, but that s frankly plenty for a meal like this. They also offer aprons for those who want them to protect their clothes, which was a nice touch. All in all, not the best I ve had but not bad.",

                    "review_text": "Tried the dakgalbi here which is really (really) good - very similar to those I ve had at home-run eateries in Korea. The seaweed rice balls were tasty too. Highly recommended for those. Flavours were on point especially the dokboki in the dakgalbi which had amazingly soft yet chewy texture  the kind that doesn t make your mouth hurt. Some other points tho - The drinks are pricey and they don t serve with ice unless you ask (even so you need to ask for extra servings of ice cos the qty is really little). You also need to ask for serviettes instead of easily accessing it at the table. Side dishes are also not served. Not sure if it s a diff in what we re used to at other Korean restaurants here but given the price levels charges, these points or lack thereof can come off as cheap? Understand business costs of course so wouldn t judge harshly on this and would return again anyway.",

We chose Crispy chicken rose tteokbokki, its creamy and sweet at the same time. And we top it up with cheese fall! But if we come back will definitely order level 3 spicy or above, as level 2 spicy is original not a hint of kick. Need add more spice to cover the sweet taste that overwhelms you after awhile. Overall will recommend cheese lovers and k food lovers to come over to come.",

First few bites tasted really good, but when you re about halfway, the taste can get really gelat because the sauce is just one dimensional.  Hence, it would be the perfect portion for 3 pax, a little too much for 2. The saving grace was the fried fritters and seaweed rice balls  they add crunch and texture to the whole dish which was just chewy throughout. Teokkbokki was the perfect chewiness for me and didn t taste like those frozen ones. Though the cabbage in the stew was way too little. Sauce dried up rather quickly over the stove so we requested to add more but the staff said no. Service wasn t great at all.",

I was very curious taste of rose teokpokki so I ordered 1 big bowl of rose teokpokki with beef brisket and added on fen hao zi and cheese fall. The taste was very similar to Samyang carbonara and level 2 spiciness was too mild and greasy for me. I saw many reviews said cheese fall was a must try. In the end we cant finish and I think I can do this myself at home with very low cost. Total it cost me $65.55 included 1 bottle of mineral water. The sauce could be better and it doesnt stand out. Perhaps my expectation is little bit too high.",

The rest of the tteokbokki was delicious though. I became full quite soon enough. So I think its suffice to say that a single cheesy tteokbokki set will fill one up easily enough. I think I picked the wrong sides, found the butter garlic fries a bit too intense (and not necessarily in the best way). Mozzarella sticks were delicious and piping hot. My partner commented that the ramyeon was yummy, but not befitting of the price. We were served big thick slices of yellow pickled radish and given a jug of icy water. Service was a bit meh. The lone, bespectacled  server we had that day was awfully quiet, almost to the point of being aloof and seemed rather shy, so we had to be louder, and called him several times to get his attention. He forgot the drink we ordered as well. But he wasnt rude, so Ill warrant a guess that he isnt too familiar with the job yet..? Its not bad a place if you have cash to splurge and youre familiar enough with Red Holic to know what you want.",

I was expecting a youth cafe and took just one bite, but it was better than I expected, huh..? I was a little embarrassed. Still, its a bit odd... Its chewy... But I dont know why they give me the oden. Its a dish made by boiling several pieces and then heating them up... Its so hard...~",

All the ingredients inside are carb-rich and starchy which made me feel nauseated after a while (Maggi noodle, glass noodle, potato starch noodle, extremely generous amount of rice cakes, dumplings with flour starch fillings?) The only meat was just a small pork cutlet for two persons to share, not to mention the absence of luncheon meat, sausages, crabsticks etc. Variety of vegetables is also very limited. It would be good to add more variety into the stew and if the portion of each ingredient can be better balanced. Nevertheless, staff service is very good! If the chopsticks could be changed to those authentic korean metal ones, instead of those plastic kopitiam chopsticks, i think the whole feel might be improved significantly.",

I think the problem with eating just tteokbokki as a main course is that it gets sickening after awhile. We got the tteokbokki pot with beef($28+) and we also added the cheese waterfall for an additional $4. The portions were quite generous and I think 2-3 people could share it. The sauce was way too sweet for our liking but the ricecakes and other toppings were nice. Note that there is a lot of chewing involved. We also ordered the giant dumplings($1.80 each) - the meat dumpling was not bad, while the kimchi dumpling was a tad too hot/spicy. Oh yes, and the place was too warm!",
