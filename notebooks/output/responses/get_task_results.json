I will definitely recommend the spicy seafood kimchi carbonara the most because the taste is perfect for me. It\u2019s not too salty or creamy. The texture of the noodles is perfect as well. The Laoban is a very genuine guy and has very good customer service. Atmosphere is also fantastic. The cold noodles took a little longer to be served but it\u2019s because they have their own way of making the noodles taste good by placing it in a machine before it\u2019s served so no complaints.",

The price for \"buy 2 free 2 meat\" BBQ was shown at around $26 on the menu, but it turns out to be $69 after adding to cart. The e-menu was really hard to navigate.\n\nThe portion of the food was little and was told we cant top up the side dishes except for the lettuce. Even so, the lettuce was served in a small bowl and in odd shapes which made it difficult to wrap the meat. All the other korean restaurants i went to served unlimited side dishes.\n\nThe kimchi soup, placed in the middle of the bbq pot, was priced at $7.90 with just kimchi in it. No laden was given, though it's quite obvious we will need one. The restaurant is very short-handed.\n\nThe only thing good about this place is the they serve decent beer, and outdoor dining is romantic. If you are looking to have a decent korean meal, you should go elsewhere. But if you are looking for a nice place to chill, then you can consider coming here.",

Conveniently located within walking distance from Riviera LRT, they have Korean BBQ, fried chicken, ramen, bulgogi and many more, even fine selection of beer on tap and cocktails.\n\nWe had:\n\ud83e\udd62Mul-Naengmyeon Cold Noodle $15.90+: Forget about hot and humid weather with this refreshing & appetizing noodle served in icy cold broth. Using noodles imported from Korea, the noodles had an enjoyable qq and chewy texture. The accompanied seaweed, sliced cucumbers, Korean pears, boiled egg and kimchi further elevated the overall taste! Special mention to the kimchi which was so so so crunchy!\n\ud83e\udd62Spicy Seafood Kimchi Carbonara $17.90+: Pasta was al dente and was a perfect match with their inhouse made spicy kimchi sauce which was creamy, flavourful and not heavy. We also enjoyed the variety of fresh seafood. Unique pasta that you cannot miss!\n\ud83e\udd62Kabi Pork Belly $15.90+: Authentic marination and pork belly was flavourful, tender and juicy.\n\ud83e\udd62Special Flaming Scallop $21.90+: Watch the crew torched the scallop into flames! The savoury special sauce was delicious and scallops were fresh!\n\nGreat ambience & vibes with great service from friendly crew. The portions were also generous. I saw many happy diners with their Korean BBQ and fried chicken which looked so mouthwatering. Definitely need to try these next round.",

Quite disappointed in the place, not even close to an authentic Korean place.\n\nOrdered 3 for 3 ($75+), 2 for 2 ($50+), Naengmyeon, Jjangmyeon, and other side dishes. Total amounted to $350 for 10 pax. Interesting idea to have a \"Buy 3 Free 3\" BBQ dishes when it's not really \"Free\" since 2.5 plates of meat is just nice for 1 pax.\n\nComplimentary side dishes are only given with each BBQ set (2 for 2 OR 3 for 3) and are Not free flow, given 2 saucer sized sets for 10 Pax.\n\nMeat was fresh and of good cuts but portion is little. Would recommend the Naengmyeon, Spicy Bulgogi. Chicken wings are not marinated well.\nOverall the meal feels healthy due to lack of salts in the food.\n\nStaff were very quick in attending to us due to lack of patrons.\n\nLove the location, many other restaurants around in the area. To be warned that this place is 80% open air and though sheltered, rain may still affect your experience.",

The price for buy 2 free 2 meat BBQ was shown at around $26 on the menu, but it turns out to be $69 after adding to cart. The e-menu was really hard to navigate. The portion of the food was little and was told we cant top up the side dishes except for the lettuce. Even so, the lettuce was served in a small bowl and in odd shapes which made it difficult to wrap the meat. All the other korean restaurants i went to served unlimited side dishes. The kimchi soup, placed in the middle of the bbq pot, was priced at $7.90 with just kimchi in it. No laden was given, though its quite obvious we will need one. The restaurant is very short-handed. The only thing good about this place is the they serve decent beer, and outdoor dining is romantic. If you are looking to have a decent korean meal, you should go elsewhere. But if you are looking for a nice place to chill, then you can consider coming here.",

The Laoban is a very genuine guy and has very good customer service. Atmosphere is also fantastic. The cold noodles took a little longer to be served but it s because they have their own way of making the noodles taste good by placing it in a machine before it s served so no complaints.",

Ordered 3 for 3 ($75+), 2 for 2 ($50+), Naengmyeon, Jjangmyeon, and other side dishes. Total amounted to $350 for 10 pax. Interesting idea to have a Buy 3 Free 3 BBQ dishes when its not really Free since 2.5 plates of meat is just nice for 1 pax. Complimentary side dishes are only given with each BBQ set (2 for 2 OR 3 for 3) and are Not free flow, given 2 saucer sized sets for 10 Pax. Meat was fresh and of good cuts but portion is little. Would recommend the Naengmyeon, Spicy Bulgogi. Chicken wings are not marinated well. Overall the meal feels healthy due to lack of salts in the food. Staff were very quick in attending to us due to lack of patrons. Love the location, many other restaurants around in the area. To be warned that this place is 80% open air and though sheltered, rain may still affect your experience. Parking: 3 gantry car parks Street parking outside.",

Poor food quality. 20/11/23- Came back today and the meal still sucks. Sour not fresh side dishes. Updates : Both myself and husband got food poisoning and feeling bloated. Went to the clinic. Fyi, we ordered the army stew with some seafood in it including abalones and mussels. We also ordered a side dish, fried enoki. The radish and kimchi arent home made or freshly made, it was all preserved canned. Totally dissapointed and hope none of you got food poisoning as unfortunate as we are.

The restaurants beautiful alfresco dining provided the perfect ambiance for a delightful evening. The highlight of the meal was definitely the Sweet & Spicy Chicken Wings, priced at S$11.50. To add an extra touch of excitement, I couldnt resist trying the Flaming Cheese (S$7.90) that was set on fire right before my eyes. The combination of flavors was absolutely mouthwatering. For a unique treat, I indulged in the Special Flaming Scallop (S$14.90), which arrived with a tantalizing blend of sweet and savory sauces. It was truly an eye-opener! To beat the Singapore heat, I opted for the refreshing Naengmyeon Cold Noodles (S$15.90), a perfect choice for the warm weather. The Spicy Seafood Kimchi Carbonara (S$18.90) brought together the best of both worlds spice and creaminess for a delightful fusion dish. Lastly, I enjoyed a refreshing Ice Tea and Citron Tea to complement the flavors of the meal.",

Conveniently located within walking distance from Riviera LRT, they have Korean BBQ, fried chicken, ramen, bulgogi and many more, even fine selection of beer on tap and cocktails. We had: Mul-Naengmyeon Cold Noodle $15.90+: Forget about hot and humid weather with this refreshing & appetizing noodle served in icy cold broth. Using noodles imported from Korea, the noodles had an enjoyable qq and chewy texture. The accompanied seaweed, sliced cucumbers, Korean pears, boiled egg and kimchi further elevated the overall taste! Special mention to the kimchi which was so so so crunchy! Spicy Seafood Kimchi Carbonara $17.90+: Pasta was al dente and was a perfect match with their inhouse made spicy kimchi sauce which was creamy, flavourful and not heavy. We also enjoyed the variety of fresh seafood. Unique pasta that you cannot miss! Kabi Pork Belly $15.90+: Authentic marination and pork belly was flavourful, tender and juicy. Special Flaming Scallop $21.90+: Watch the crew torched the scallop into flames! The savoury special sauce was delicious and scallops were fresh! Great ambience & vibes with great service from friendly crew. The portions were also generous. I saw many happy diners with their Korean BBQ and fried chicken which looked so mouthwatering. Definitely need to try these next round.",

When the army stew arrived, what we got is SO TOTALLY different from what was shown in the menu!! It s so not worth the $55 charged for the food! The ingredients were just spam, sausage, fried popcorn chicken, toboki, veggies, tofu and some dumplings! We feel so cheated!! After the army stew, it took another 15 mins for our ordered rice bowl to arrive. We then reminded them that we still have fish and chips and white rice not served. Nobody came back to us about it. N we waited another 15-20 mins and had finished the rest of the meals by then My kid was starving and so I asked again and only after I said that we want to cancel the order were we informed that the order was being cooked and will be served shortly. I told them that was not our problem and we want to cancel and get a refund. They came back with $12 when the cost on the menu is $12.90 before gst and service charge!! They also didn t refund us for the white rice until we reminded them! Everything is just so terrible! We left home for dinner early so we didn t have to squeeze with the crowd but in the end had to wait for 1hr for our food to be served. Please do not go! We will not be coming back again! Definitely not worth the money and spoilt our dinner and mood!",

The gas burner were rusty as well. Not sure why are there so many good reviews. Better off at Seoul garden. Give me authentic Korean bbq anytime since the total bill ain t much significant.

We were prepared for the long wait for food . But just to grab 2 bottles of beer off the fridge and homemade pre-prepared drinks takes  60 min ?? 2) Korean BBQ - worst ever . Marinated Beef was virtually minced that it s so hard to cook that it fell off from the holes on the grill . On the other hand No scissors / thongs were provided to cut the slab of pork . Seafood ( frozen dory fish , 2 pcs of squid ring , 1 scallop and clams ) are just taken off the freezer . Korean water soup - just plain water ? 3) space was so limited on the table that the servers just passed the food to our hands to fix the problem on our own . No sorry / apologies.",

Edit: extremely sad for the price. I had paid $15 per meal in order to bite into 3 pieces of seashell in my aglio olio + the food had virtually no seasoning. Batter on fish fritter was hard and firm like a piece of wet roti prata, and the fish had a structural integrity similar to firm tau kua. Aglio olio had a tinge of mee sedap flavour. The most flavourful thing on the plate are the fries, baked beans and the slice of lemon.",

Lastly the cold noodle is horrible, very bland and not at all authentic. Too much corner cut for that. The homemade tea is a good mix of sweetness and sourness although on the pricy side.

We were supposed to collect our own food but the calling system was confusing. The receipt show an order number but the food was called based on table number. We saw some tables missed their calls too. I would have given 2 stars if not for the friendly staff who was apologetic when we missed our call and waited 30mins for our drinks. Anyway, they need to improve the system and the soup for army stew.",

I would highly recommend these two dishes. This is also a good place if you intend to chill out with family or friends. Can choose to be seated either indoor or outdoor. Personally I would recommend outdoor seating for 2 reasons : The indoor aircon is freezing cold. Not that comfortable if you intend to sit long. Their indoor seating is pretty small and quiet. Even if you will to talk softly, the echo of your sound can easily be heard in the whole room. Sometimes you may feel uncomfortable if other table patrons are chatting loudly. Excellent service. Good vibes overall !",
