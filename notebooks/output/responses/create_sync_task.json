A nice place to enjoy the parathas curries , Biriyani and kebabs we well with some unique creations from the chef. Vegetarian options: Lot of North Indian vegetarian choices Parking: Adequate parking at mall Kid-friendliness: Easy to find something the kids will like and the space is good Wheelchair accessibility: Easily accessible by wheelchair from the mall",

A special shout out to staff Roselle , who helped me organise, suggest appropriate quantity and varying dishes and was extremely efficient and patient through out the celebration. A big thanks to Awadh staff and specially Roselle. We will come back again.",

As i love Awadhi food n experienced different cuisins in SG n india bcoz of its teste n aroma we decided to try here n really disapponited. Its realy a over hyped place, Food price is too much compare to quantity n teste. Being a Awadhi Restaurent they dont know n dont serve Dum Biriyani n proper toonduri preparation. We ordered Chicken Biriyani at S$25 which is  just like Masala Biriyani available in any indian food court at $8. Rice quality also not fine. Some yellow colour rice fr one person quantiy with 4-5 pieces small chicken n much cooking well. Yes they dont use ghee or cow milk fat fr cooking. No use of zafran or safron. We order Galawati kebab, price is $24, four moderate size kebab served in a big plate wth little cheese :-) , kebab was soft n flavourfull of mithi aatar but quantity is little only also mutton was less in it.. They served little quantity in a big plare as they r charging high price, not a single place of salad with Kebab but given lil cheese with it which is wrong choice. Apart from that we ordered some veg preparations which were so so kind. What is missing here the touch of Awadh but they r presenting themself as Fine Royal Dinning of Awadh.. its totally miss guiding customer. When we were having food around 60 people came with tour company to have indian buffet food, yes thats why they r running there business here.. also they serve few indian chinese foods also though we have not tried it. They charge 10% service tax but we hardly got any service there, Every time our glass emptied we have to look fr them n asked for water then we got water.. We got 2 buckets of papad as complementary.. There is no wash basin in shop as its in a mall so u have to go out to wash ur hand or naturs call. Overall its not at all Fine Awadhi dining restaurent they r miss guiding people by FB Ad. We will not recomend this restaurent to have any food at all sorry to say. Thank u",

Very poor service, they didn t give water, complimentary fryums when I asked then only they served. I waited more than 30-40mnts for our food even though not much crowded bcoz we went at 10.15 pm but still they made us to wait for longer. Food quality was very very horrible. Sunehara paneer tikka which was very pathetic. Chicken biryani not at all tasty. I forgot to click food pics. Compare to other Indian restaurants price is higher. Live music was nice. 1 extra star only for live music.",

And, for one naan, you wait forever because they forgot that you even ordered. Food went cold while I waited for 20 mins for one naan.

Even though it is expensive than other Indian restaurants in the area, we decided to go hoping the food would be nice. But I can say it was one of the worst taste Indian food we ever experienced. Simply a horrible experience. At the time we arrived, there was a private function going on and it was very loud and a couple of people were singing loud. We ordered 1 Multani Kadhai Paneer, 1 Chicken Biryani, and 2 Naans. It took about 45 minutes to take our order, which can be considered as ok, but surprisingly they took the dishes we hadnt ordered as well. When we were looking menu, we asked the staff what kind of dish is Achari Paneer Tikka and they said it comes as a starter. So we didnt order it, but they prepared it and added it to our order. Since we clearly said we didnt want that in our meal, we asked them to take it back. But the staff were too arrogant and said however we have to pay for it. We ended up paying nearly SGD100 just for 3 dishes. And the worst thing was the taste of the food, Chicken Biryani was smelly and undercooked. Paneer was too thick and Naans were too dry and flakey. I wonder why they are serving their customers too badly. Honestly, we thought we could have eaten from just a convenience store for better food than there",

They refused to use HSBC entertainer discount 1-for-1 mains, reason there is a live show happening and they do not honor entertainer discount, but there is no such T&C. Prices are exorbitant. A roti is priced at $9++, reason the wheat flour is now expensive.. a roti uses less than 50gms of flour. cost of 50gms of flour increased from  about 6 cents to 12 cents max.

The other starter was Kalmi Kebab and by the satisfactorily expressions on my friends face it was nothing sort of another delicious starter. We ended up with Murgh Lucknow Masala and Safed Moti Masala. Since we were celebrating anniversary the place even surprised us with Shahi Tukda.

Poor Shaam Savera Kofta was a vegetable kofta, consisting of exactly 3 pieces of Broccoli and very little else. Lazeez Kathy Biryani. ( jackfruit biryani) Bland and flavourless. Might as well have been plain rice. Naan and roti were ok but frankly, after paying $105 for this stuff, I certainly wont be back.",

Enjoyed the cocktails, kebabs, tikka, grilled prawns, Nan and mutton. Great flavours of spices and perfect cooking. The bartender Mr. Yatin makes excellent cocktails. He has his own recipes of blending the liquors to get outstanding mixes. Other staffs are also caring and supportive. They gave homely feeling and suggested the best dishes for us. Especially need to mention Ms. Afshan name for the same. Live band singer is really talented with a great voice. Overall we enjoyed everything at AWADH.",

During the reservation, I mentioned in the special requests for the restaurant to arrange a dessert or a special drink as a surprise on the table. The restaurant missed(or forgot) it - but ironically, there was a couple beside our table who were also celebrating a birthday. And the restaurant did arrange a cake for them- not sure why the hiccup. 2. In terms of hospitality, one of the managers was overlooking the guests, and we saw her personally reaching out to everyone else to ask about the food- Everyone except Us. Not sure why the bias. 3. There were instances where the manager was seen/heard yelling at the staff members and talking rudely. This was an unpleasant and awkward moment for me as a guest. 4. Food wise, theres a lot of scope to improve the taste. I did not feel value for money for the menu. Giving this as a feedback for the restaurant to take note on.",

Ordered curry - mix veg (navratan korma) chef is using watties mix veg to cook mix veg, turmeric smell too harsh, seems masale were not cooked well. Finally returned it. Also informed chef about the same. Paneer butter masala - bit eatable but on the sweeter side. Panner pieces were too hard to chew. As had no other options so you what i meant. Masala tea - had masala missing. We were provided a complementary rasmalai but it so sweet thats its not worth it. garlic naan, cheese naan, paneer kulcha - were awesome.",

She recommended the $25.90 brunch with 1 Chaat/ Appetizer unlimited and 1 main course. I told her I do not like sweet food and she recommended the Samosa Chaat, a potato filled crisps with yogurt and chutney. It was delicious. My main course is the Mutton Bun Kebab, with minced mutton patty fried to golden brown, caramelized onions and buttered bun. This is fabulous too, not too salty but bun is a little tough, not for the elderly who have trouble chewing. The mutton patty is nice. I finished the appetizer and had a third of the bun then take away the leftover. I also ordered the Martini Bianco $12 as Rosia said it isnt as sweet as Martini Rosso. The drink is nice. After dinner, I ordered another Martini Negroni $17, which is supposedly a stronger drink that is more popular with guys. I like it too, strong and balance. For gals, they may want some lime juice in it. Total is about $65 as I had two alcohol drinks. It is still value for money, especially the brunch that is available on Sat, Sun and Public Holiday from 10.30 am to 4.30 pm. Highly recommend this restaurant to all.",

I read the reviews before choosing this shop, and someone stated that the briyani was amazing, which made me wanted to try it. The chicken was not cooked properly, tasteless, can see brownish colour meat which does not looks fresh, rice was pale, just was colorful rice but tasteless. Only can get the chutney taste which was given together with the rice. Am not sure hows the other food choices, but it is a BIG NO for briyani. Is my honest review, because I do not want other briyani lovers out there to share my disappointment. Previously I went Shakuntala restaurant, although their briyani rice is a bit pale but their chicken is thoroughly cooked, rich with aromas and flavours. I should have gone there again, rather than trying out Awadhs.",

Food : Pathetic taste. We ordered Dahi Kebab, Seekh Kebab and Subz Biryani. Dahi Kebab was extremely oily, bland and nothing like it should taste. Subz Biryani had no spice and salt. Seekh Kebab was the only saviour with decent taste. Service : Zero customer orientation. They were busy upselling drinks to us when we were talking to them about food quality. One person listened to what we said and then started speaking to another colleague. No apology, no offer to change / redress concerns and absolutely no desire to make our experience better. Live music was really good and made everything somewhat bearable. IF YOU HAVE A REASONABLY EVOLVED PALATE FOR INDIAN FOOD, PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE.",

You can t enjoy food in such noisy place with family eventually I left before ordering food. This is not place for Family Dining out.",

Mr Kamran was very kind to lower the heat in the dishes, and made excellent recommendation, specifically the minced lamb patties (also called kebabs in Lucknow). We had the Pasqua Amarone that was kinda sweet, that went really well with the spicy food. will definitely return, and may well be my go to place for indian cuisine.",

Food was good there, especially Paneer tikka, as it was super soft and flavorful. Other than this, we also had kadhai paneer, samosa, and lassi, but it was not as I expected. Lassi was so watery and had some bitter taste. The service was good. I was a little disappointed because before going I called them and told them about my special occasion, and they said yes you could come we will give you a special table or something. But they didnt do anything special. They had lit candles on all tables except ours, and I had to ask them to light the candle at least. Our celebration didnt go as expected.",

It would be great if the food portions are bigger. Overall it was an amazing experience and we would definitely be back!",

You may say that the only thing matters is food. But at a place where a cocktail costs more than the meal, then you tend to expect more from ambience. Hence, only 1/5 for it. Service: Very nice. They kept on asking what else do you need and all. But there is a fine line between good service and being too much pushy and not giving customer their space. A friend of mine felt that way. Hence 3/5 for service. Food: Galuti kabab and Mutton Nihari of this place is amazing. It has potential to be in top 10 of Singapore. But their biryani sucked. A complete waste of appetite. Overall 4/5 for food. In general, its a nice north indian place which serves good food. Some of these food resembles few dishes from Lucknow. But when you bring in the price point and compare them with other Indian restaurants. You would start to question, should you go back for another meal?",

Above all the staff members were absolutely courteous and were able to recommend some good food on the menu. My only concern and perhaps the reason which may abstain me from visiting the place again was the kind of food served in an environment which does not support a sizzling hotplate dish. It gives out heavy and spicy smoke effect . Diners sitting on the right and left of my table ordered the sizzler and smoke engulfed the whole place and I ended up having  irritant eyes which began to tear profusely. Unfortunately, I came in for lunch after my eye procedure and one could imagine the discomfort I experienced. I wouldnt mind when such sizzler dishes are served if there is proper exhaust system. Will be good for the restaurant to reconsider serving such dishes in the future. Being a vegetarian I was not comfortable being engulfed in such a smoke environment though! Although I was not fussy about being  doused in that smoke, I should say my clothes smelt bad and it lingered on me. Will be good if the management could be more sensitive to other diners and look into how to serve sizzlers with proper system in place. My heartfelt thanks to the staff members who were fast to react with wet tissues to wipe my eyes off the smoke irritants. Thk you again.",

The portion sizes are incredibly small making them incredibly over priced. There was a food item missing too - when i rang them they asked me to whatsapp a photo and gave me a landline number despite me double checking if thats the correct number - in the end it was not.. Very disappointing considering it has such a high google review - dont be mislead! Would not order from here ever again.",

Suffice to say that Awadh s food was outstanding enough for its taste to linger well past 3 months. To someone jaded by the typical  north indian  food on offer in Singapore, Awadh delivers a shot of exuberant zing to the palate, with the food we ordered (recommended by the maitre d Arjan) hitting all the right notes. The Subz Galawat Kabab, Zaffrani Paneer Tikka, Bhatti Ka Murg and Subz Biriyani - all made for a meal most memorable. Apple Jalebi lives up to its exotic name - a superb finish to an outstanding meal. Skip the drinks unless you re in a mood to indulge. And we hope Awadh finds a larger, perhaps standalone unit, where its food and service can truly shine.",

They just put boiled chicken with half cooked rice with no taste. Chicken curry masala was also not cooked.you can smell raw flavour in all chicken items. It really spoiled my day by wasting my money.Please go though the review in food carefully in food panda before ordering.",

The highlight was even the basic kadhai paneer didnt taste well here and the naan we ordered was not at all fresh and it was too hard . Just like previous day naan preserved and toasted.. The price was damn expensive for such a small portion. I am surprised to see good reviews on the taste of the food here.. . The total was 110$ for such small portions and only the sides tasted well here that too, its limited to 3 pieces while u get a good portion in other michelin star restaurants. Wasted our money here.

After going inside, we came to know that its a one Thali (plate) where 2 people can share. It contains some 10 varieties of curries including sweet and curd  in a very limited quantity (very less for 2) and contains 1 naan (very small size) with some rice. (photo attached) Honestly, the quantity is not justified for 2 pax. Moreover the taste was very normal and nothing exclusive. I would really not like to go again for this much cost and for this less quantity. It clearly seemed to be a cheating where they want the people coming to order explicitly something extra because the quantity is not enough for 2 persons. They should actually mention this on internet about this. Lets say, if you are going officially or with the office colleague, how could you expect to share the plate. On top of this, they would be forcing you to order something from their menu like drinks and kebabs.",

Unfortunately my second visit really disappointed me. I went back to this place on 14th feb which happens to be our anniversary as well. Since my husbamd is from lucknow i wanted to get some close to home taste. After we sat down we were informed that only set menus are available and it was 70$ per person. Since we alrdy reserved the place we went ahead with the set menu. I was surprised to find the food quality to be just average and in the main course it was chicken biriyani with some regular paneer n daal with egg gravy. None of the dishes delighted our taste buds. Since we cudnt even finish it we asked them to pack the food, and then came the second surprise - we hav to pay 10$ for packing. I mean where on earth ppl charge for packing when they hav already charged for the food. After some argument and unnecessary discussion we got that 10$ waived but it spoilt the mood for the rest of the day. We wud hav happily paid had the food taste and quality were really good. I myself recommended this place to several ppl, but m sad to say that i m never going to go back to awadh n neither u would recommend to anyone. You have let us down big time!",

From the very first meeting with Ms Manisha and Mr Amitabh, we were blown away by their warmth and hospitality! Firstly, the ambience of the restaurant is amazing, what with the pretty chandeliers and all. Secondly, the food is wonderful! The way everything comes together is a tantalising treat for the Taste buds. Finally, the service is exceptional! They are very humble and attentive and helpful and they were so accommodating to our ideas and wishes and when we marched in that evening, we were so amazed at how everything had turned out. Its pretty scary to have had to plan a reception, albeit a small one but with so many restrictions, what with the pandemic and all, but everything was so smooth and effortless and we didnt have to worry as everything was well taken care of! After the reception, all our guests sang praises about the quality and taste of the food. Everyone enjoyed it immensely! They enjoyed the ambience, the food and how accommodating and quick the staff were. We are truly so deeply grateful to everyone at Awadh for having us and for enabling us to have a wonderful reception and most importantly for taking such wonderful care of our guests! In spite of the pandemic and restrictions, we were able to have a wonderful reception and we are truly blessed and thankful because for that day we truly felt like royalty! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!",

The cottage cheese (paneer) was definitely far from fresh, the texture of the samosa showed its age, the roti and naan were sub-par and just a couple of the dishes we ordered were any good. You can get far better and fresher food at lower prices and consistent quality at places like Zaffron kitchen or the Indian curry house. Will definitely not recommend this restaurant. (update on 19 Jan 2021) Both my wife and I came down with a severe reaction after this meal. Had to rush her to hospital early this morning. I felt slightly ill but recovered faster.",

It s listed as a Royal fine dining place. The dishes were homely and tasty with just the right portion. There were quite a variety of vegetarian options. Starter: We tried the Fauladi Kebab and Paneer Kathi Roll. Both were quite good. The Kebab came with a green chutney with its nice spicy flavour. Main Course: We went for the Kadai Paneer and Lehsuni Motiya Palak. The Kadai Paneer is spicy while the Palak dish is rich and creamy. They complement well with any bread (Naan or Roti) and balance your palette. Dessert: Phirni comes in 2 flavours Malai Phirni was particularly the winner of the desert lot. It comes in another flavour of rose milk. In conclusion it was delightful dinner for us. The prices are comparatively on the higher side but seems okay for the taste and outcome of dishes.",

I d start by sharing that their food is delirious. What we ordered was : Bhatti Ka Murgh, Gosht Galawat Kebab, Ulte Tawe Ka Paratha, Murgh Seekh Kebab, Murgh Chandi Tikka, Mutton Biryani, Butter Chicken, Dal E Khas, Rumali Roti, Cheese Naan, Garlic Naan, Magaj Naan. Their food is finger licking good. Amitabh who is the owner deserves a special mention here because we were to host certain set of folks and we needed a solid recommendation and wanted the chef to make the food with extra love. The food totally lived up to our expectations. Once you get to speak to Amitabh, you would know he is such a kind person and has some great suggestions to make. The staff Anjali and Neha are quite smart and patient too. Before finalising the menu, we spoke to Neha and she has a very calm demeanour. Just when she thought we were going a little overboard with ordering the food, she did not even hesitate to tell us that we might waste it, if we order more. How nice of her! :) They also sent us Milai Phirni which was a complimentary dish! Their food is so good that we literally went into food coma. I would highly recommend this place to you. Go book it now and I am sure you d come back wanting for more!",

For the same or similar food, might have cost just half or less than half if you get it elsewhere. Service was reasonable and the atmosphere so-so. Yea I get it that maybe a lot of hard work and spices were in them, but really couldn t stomach the price tag. The broccoli appetizer is kind of special, first time seeing broccoli cooked this way, and it taste good. Food is definitely delicious especially the Naan, but will I come back again?

There was really nothing special about the menu and service and food quality were far below expectations. Firstly, the staff took a fairly long time to give us menus and take our orders although it was a weekday and restaurant was running at half capacity. The waiters were not attentive and lacked the knowledge about the menu so that we could make our choices. Next, the food took an inordinate amount of time to arrive although it was a set meal - considering most dishes would be pre-prepared. The food arrived cold, only the naans were hot - we guessed that took time. The gulab jamun was cold and hard and none of us had more than a bite. The basmati rice was just a plain pilau - did not match the fancy name stated in the menu. Would give this place a one star if not for the saving grace - the buttermilk as an aperitif at the start was perfect and refreshing for a hot day. Just wished the staff were more active and genuine about attending to the customers. Maybe the main menu would have been much more appetising but it will take me some time before I try this place again as Ive had much better Indian food for equally priced meals.",

We rushed back and they had safely kept it with them. Not a single cent was taken and it was kept securely until we returned. Thank you, Awadh for such exceptional service, honestly and brilliant food. Will certainly be returning.",

So I was super excited to learn a restaurant attempting to showcase the cuisine of Awadh has opened here. I went with low expectations, because even in India, getting good Awadhi food outside Lucknow is very hard. I was very pleasantly surprised I must confess. The owner and his wife are from the state, and the chef is from the city, which definitely shows in the food. We tried the Galawati (translates to melt in your mouth) kebab, which is the acid test of any Awadhi restaurant. Ive not had this good a kebab outside of India. It is a tricky dish to get right, with a lot of spices going in to get it right. We also tried the Thali, which had a variety of chicken, lamb and veggie dishes, all with their unique flavors standing out (a very hard thing to do as most indian restaurants take a short cut and put everything in similar gravies). The dessert of rose phrini was also excellent. I will be back for sure. Give this place a try and experience an unique side of Indian cuisine which isnt easily available outside of the city of Lucknow these days!",

I am a big fan of awadh cuisine having spent many years in Lucknow and was really excited to try this new restaurant whose claim to fame is Lucknowi cuisine. The galawati kebab and kalmi kebab were very nicely recreated. The taste was very close to the original. Thoroughly enjoyed the starters including the paneer wrap. The chicken korma was to the point and really good too. However, the dish that we were most excited about disappointed the most. The highlight of Awadhi cuisine is the Lucknowi biriyani of the likes of Idris and Ishtiyaque. Sadly the biriyani was normal Singaporean indian restaurant biriyani with yellow rice and chicken. The chef was so lazy that birista (fried onion) was the prepackaged dry one and not freshly prepared. The aromatics Lucknowi biriyani is known for were completely absent. Ambience is very basic as well as the service and prices are a tad bit high for the overall experience . I would recommend galawati kebab and korma.  Steer clear of the biriyani.",

However, their prices could have been more competitive. It was a little pricy. Their customer service was quite efficient and speedy. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I would definitely recommend you to visit this place when they have an offer for a special occasion. There is a lot of vegetarian options as well.",

The preset thali took around 1hour  arrive. The serving staff was clueless. Few tables around us cancelled the orders and left as well as they couldn t wait. How can a preselected menu of thali take so long to arrive when nearly all tables are pre-reserved? The excuse was that they prepare the food fresh but after the 1 hour wait, food served was cold/luke warm at best. I wish the food was worth the wait but that a massive disappointment as well. How can you serve such sub-standard food and charge fine dining prices. The mutton was just salty and flavourless, chicken was like that from a ordinary Food court. The gulab jamun was hard and straight out from a supermarket can.  The only 1 item was good was the kebab. Everything else was what you would get at a substandard Indian stall at a food court. Need to  get  your act together guys. Most of the 5 reviews seem to be fake as this was easily the worst Indian meal in my 10 years in Singapore.",

For people, especially Lucknowites like me who have tasted Galawat Kebab in Tunday and Dastarkhwan, it is my humble request please dont compare their Kebabs to the ones you will taste in Awadh, else you will be heartbroken. Those ones are mouthwatering juicy, very tender, carry a certain tickle and taste that cant be described, hence they are Galawat in truest sense. The ones you get to taste here are more like a dry version of those which wont have that juiceness, a bit more hard textured, and the authenticity or the tickle you will not find. As evident from the photo itself, you can judge the difference. I ordered Kebabs from this restaurant only after my research getting to know the history behind and therefore I had certain expectations. But after trying these, I realized have to wait another 6-8 months before I travel Lucknow. For other folks, I hope they will like these Kebabs :) I am not sure if this falls under any improvement space upon the restaurant since its a very delicate dish, but as someone who was rooting and feeling proud to finally find a restaurant in Singapore that can serve those authentic Galawat Kebabs all the way from Lucknow, I felt a bit disappointed and therefore this long review. Nevertheless, I wish Awadh best of luck in their success. -Vivek",

The mutton biryani is the favourite - really well done and mutton pieces were tender. The veg kebab truly melts in your mouth, dont doubt the description in the menu! The dal is one of the best we have had in a long time, thick and flavours were just right. The saffron dessert was also fantastic to end the meal! Overall the food wasnt too salty nor oily, but full of flavor and taste is pretty authentic. In addition, delivery was later than promised so they gave us complimentary naan and rose dessert. Gotta say its great customer recovery!! Would love to visit the restaurant for a dine in experience once this circuit breaker is over!",

From the papads with mint chutney to the chefs reccomendations and ending with the Phirni, we had a delightful and memorable time. We went in early and had the full attention of the servers. We had no waiting between emptying our plates as we gobbled up the appetizers to having the next plate delivered. The decor is inviting. Highly reccomend (we only ordered non veg  items as we are biased like that  )",

The staff was really attentive and gave us thoughtful suggestions for our meal, given that we were all vegetarians. The food was freshly prepared, delicately flavoured and subtly spiced capturing the fine nuances of Awadhi cuisine. Our vegetarian galouti kababs were delectable paired well with ulte tawe ka parantha recommended by the staff and the garlic naan was one of the best we had in recent times. All in all, a great addition to Singapore s Indian dining scene.",

The kebabs made in the old Mughalii tradition, melt in the mouth! The gravy dishes are made to perfection, each one with it s own flavours and aromas! Even the dessert was excellent and cooked as it should be - original authentic taste! My husband and I loved the food so much that in our 14 days stay in Singapore, we visited the restaurant thrice! The live indian music, nostalgic and wonderful, added to our wonderful experience and enjoyment! We shall soon return and look forward to savouring the fantastic Mughlai food again at Avadh ! All the best to Avadh for success in the future so we can keep visiting you and treating ourselves to your exquisite cuisine! Gopi and Ashwani Sharma",

The main course was yellow fall and green vegetables, starters were something made with soybean. Couldnt find one dish for which I would want to return to this place. I am usually not so harsh but what was advertised and what came out were stark contrast",

Their signature dish, Galawat Kebabs were SO disappointing.. Not only was the presentation below average, but the portions were laughable.. We got 5 measly (smaller than bite sized) pieces.. Cannot describe the taste as it felt like a small bite of kebab that gets over before it touches your tongue!! 2. The servers seemed very confused.. We did not have 1 particular server for our table.. And each server had their own answers to the same questions we were asking. 3. We waited for a really long time for our food only to realise it is going to different tables and our biryani was even served to a plate on a different table! Only to see the server taking it back.. Roaming around with it all over the place and getting it to our table after a good 10 minutes.. Cold, obviously! 4. The ambience was good but it was the last thing on my mind when I left the place! 5. Is it a bad idea to go to a place which has opened up 2 weeks ago? I understand teething troubles but in every aspect?? 6. Found out that the owners were sitting right outside the restaurant - Why? You guys should be sitting inside watching how your staff is getting everything wrong, overselling drinks and alcohol, making us wait and then serving the wrong tables.. Sitting outside defeats the purpose since you ll only hear biased stories from the staff.. This place has great potential if executed right! But for me, not coming back again (for now)",

Gravies are mainly paneer oriented & this keeps your taste buds to only taste paneer. DONT order Tandoori roti, it was 25% cooked. 3. The worst part was the so called LIVE PERFORMANCE. The sound was blaring & if your with your family you cant even talk to each other because of this noise. The setting was very badly organized. Moreover the performer & staff were very rude & inconsiderate that we requested them thrice to reduce the volume because we had a child sleeping and a pregnant lady & yet they refused to reduce the volume too. 4. A bit highly priced for that variety but wirth for the quality. 5. On the whole, if you want to taste the food better TAKE AWAY or HOME DELIVERY because service was very very poor & the noise is very annoying not letting you to enjoy your meal. The management must consider to improve the service & change the performance to a very pleasing one.",

I very rarely go out for Indian food but the food here has amazing flavour and is different from other mainstream restaurants. The lamb galauti kebab melts in your mouth and tastes amazing. The chicken briyani is the best I have had and the butter chicken is very unique in a very good way. Other dishes were good too but these were the highlights. I highly recommend this place if you want good quality Indian food where flavours are so rich, the hosts are hospitable and a place to chill with good music!",

Great for people who need to entertain guest but also a quiet night with their loved ones!!!",

As i love Awadhi food n experienced different cuisins in SG n india bcoz of its teste n aroma we decided to try here n really disapponited. Its realy a over hyped place, Food price is too much compare to quantity n teste. Being a Awadhi Restaurent they dont know n dont serve Dum Biriyani n proper toonduri preparation. We ordered Chicken Biriyani at S$25 which is  just like Masala Biriyani available in any indian food court at $8. Rice quality also not fine. Some yellow colour rice fr one person quantiy with 4-5 pieces small chicken n much cooking well. Yes they dont use ghee or cow milk fat fr cooking. No use of zafran or safron. We order Galawati kebab, price is $24, four moderate size kebab served in a big plate wth little cheese :-) , kebab was soft n flavourfull of mithi aatar but quantity is little only also mutton was less in it.. They served little quantity in a big plare as they r charging high price, not a single place of salad with Kebab but given lil cheese with it which is wrong choice. Apart from that we ordered some veg preparations which were so so kind. What is missing here the touch of Awadh but they r presenting themself as Fine Royal Dinning of Awadh.. its totally miss guiding customer. When we were having food around 60 people came with tour company to have indian buffet food, yes thats why they r running there business here.. also they serve few indian chinese foods also though we have not tried it. They charge 10% service tax but we hardly got any service there, Every time our glass emptied we have to look fr them n asked for water then we got water.. We got 2 buckets of papad as complementary.. There is no wash basin in shop as its in a mall so u have to go out to wash ur hand or naturs call. Overall its not at all Fine Awadhi dining restaurent they r miss guiding people by FB Ad. We will not recomend this restaurent to have any food at all sorry to say. Thank u",

Sunehara paneer tikka which was very pathetic. Chicken biryani not at all tasty. I forgot to click food pics. Compare to other Indian restaurants price is higher.

When they have many customers the staff start mixing orders. Your order will be served to someone else and you will get the order you never ordered. And, for one naan, you wait forever because they forgot that you even ordered. Food went cold while I waited for 20 mins for one naan. The family sitting next to us ordered to make the food mild spicy but they forgot it and made the food super spicy. Again, mismanagement.",

                        "review_text": "We went to this restaurant last September to have authentic Indian cuisine. Even though it is expensive than other Indian restaurants in the area, we decided to go hoping the food would be nice. But I can say it was one of the worst taste Indian food we ever experienced. Simply a horrible experience. At the time we arrived, there was a private function going on and it was very loud and a couple of people were singing loud. We ordered 1 Multani Kadhai Paneer, 1 Chicken Biryani, and 2 Naans. It took about 45 minutes to take our order, which can be considered as ok, but surprisingly they took the dishes we hadnt ordered as well. When we were looking menu, we asked the staff what kind of dish is Achari Paneer Tikka and they said it comes as a starter. So we didnt order it, but they prepared it and added it to our order. Since we clearly said we didnt want that in our meal, we asked them to take it back. But the staff were too arrogant and said however we have to pay for it. We ended up paying nearly SGD100 just for 3 dishes. And the worst thing was the taste of the food, Chicken Biryani was smelly and undercooked. Paneer was too thick and Naans were too dry and flakey. I wonder why they are serving their customers too badly. Honestly, we thought we could have eaten from just a convenience store for better food than there",

The live singing was fine as long as the professional singer was singing. However few audience took it as a challenge to make audience run away and they were quite successful.

Right from the time you enter and are seated to the order being taken and then through the meal, each of the servers taking care of us were attentive, prompt and kind. Roselle was particularly brilliant, making suggestions, asking us if we were ok and if we wanted anything else in the most authentic and caring way. All of the staff really made our meal lovely!

A roti is priced at $9++, reason the wheat flour is now expensive.. a roti uses less than 50gms of flour. cost of 50gms of flour increased from  about 6 cents to 12 cents max.

Enjoyed the cocktails, kebabs, tikka, grilled prawns, Nan and mutton. Great flavours of spices and perfect cooking. The bartender Mr. Yatin makes excellent cocktails. He has his own recipes of blending the liquors to get outstanding mixes. Other staffs are also caring and supportive. They gave homely feeling and suggested the best dishes for us. Especially need to mention Ms. Afshan name for the same. Live band singer is really talented with a great voice. Overall we enjoyed everything at AWADH.",

During the reservation, I mentioned in the special requests for the restaurant to arrange a dessert or a special drink as a surprise on the table. The restaurant missed(or forgot) it - but ironically, there was a couple beside our table who were also celebrating a birthday. And the restaurant did arrange a cake for them- not sure why the hiccup. 2. In terms of hospitality, one of the managers was overlooking the guests, and we saw her personally reaching out to everyone else to ask about the food- Everyone except Us. Not sure why the bias. 3. There were instances where the manager was seen/heard yelling at the staff members and talking rudely. This was an unpleasant and awkward moment for me as a guest. 4. Food wise, theres a lot of scope to improve the taste. I did not feel value for money for the menu. Giving this as a feedback for the restaurant to take note on.",

Also, stale smell :( So finally we returned it but still we were charged. Ordered curry - mix veg (navratan korma) chef is using watties mix veg to cook mix veg, turmeric smell too harsh, seems masale were not cooked well. Finally returned it. Also informed chef about the same. Paneer butter masala - bit eatable but on the sweeter side. Panner pieces were too hard to chew. As had no other options so you what i meant. Masala tea - had masala missing. We were provided a complementary rasmalai but it so sweet thats its not worth it. garlic naan, cheese naan, paneer kulcha - were awesome.",

She recommended the $25.90 brunch with 1 Chaat/ Appetizer unlimited and 1 main course. I told her I do not like sweet food and she recommended the Samosa Chaat, a potato filled crisps with yogurt and chutney. It was delicious. My main course is the Mutton Bun Kebab, with minced mutton patty fried to golden brown, caramelized onions and buttered bun. This is fabulous too, not too salty but bun is a little tough, not for the elderly who have trouble chewing. The mutton patty is nice. I finished the appetizer and had a third of the bun then take away the leftover. I also ordered the Martini Bianco $12 as Rosia said it isnt as sweet as Martini Rosso. The drink is nice. After dinner, I ordered another Martini Negroni $17, which is supposedly a stronger drink that is more popular with guys. I like it too, strong and balance. For gals, they may want some lime juice in it. Total is about $65 as I had two alcohol drinks. It is still value for money, especially the brunch that is available on Sat, Sun and Public Holiday from 10.30 am to 4.30 pm. Highly recommend this restaurant to all.",

I read the reviews before choosing this shop, and someone stated that the briyani was amazing, which made me wanted to try it. The chicken was not cooked properly, tasteless, can see brownish colour meat which does not looks fresh, rice was pale, just was colorful rice but tasteless. Only can get the chutney taste which was given together with the rice. Am not sure hows the other food choices, but it is a BIG NO for briyani. Is my honest review, because I do not want other briyani lovers out there to share my disappointment. Previously I went Shakuntala restaurant, although their briyani rice is a bit pale but their chicken is thoroughly cooked, rich with aromas and flavours. I should have gone there again, rather than trying out Awadhs.",

Food : Pathetic taste. We ordered Dahi Kebab, Seekh Kebab and Subz Biryani. Dahi Kebab was extremely oily, bland and nothing like it should taste. Subz Biryani had no spice and salt. Seekh Kebab was the only saviour with decent taste. Service : Zero customer orientation. They were busy upselling drinks to us when we were talking to them about food quality. One person listened to what we said and then started speaking to another colleague. No apology, no offer to change / redress concerns and absolutely no desire to make our experience better. Live music was really good and made everything somewhat bearable. IF YOU HAVE A REASONABLY EVOLVED PALATE FOR INDIAN FOOD, PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE.",

For my surprise restaurant is so noisy with loud music and DJ talking nonsense in singlish as he wants to entertain customers. So loud noise in small place you wont be able to eat comfortably with Family. I was so disappointed by the overall atmosphere. You can t enjoy food in such noisy place with family eventually I left before ordering food. This is not place for Family Dining out.",

We had the Pasqua Amarone that was kinda sweet, that went really well with the spicy food. will definitely return, and may well be my go to place for indian cuisine.",

Lassi was so watery and had some bitter taste. The service was good. I was a little disappointed because before going I called them and told them about my special occasion, and they said yes you could come we will give you a special table or something. But they didnt do anything special. They had lit candles on all tables except ours, and I had to ask them to light the candle at least. Our celebration didnt go as expected.",

You may say that the only thing matters is food. But at a place where a cocktail costs more than the meal, then you tend to expect more from ambience. Hence, only 1/5 for it. Service: Very nice. They kept on asking what else do you need and all. But there is a fine line between good service and being too much pushy and not giving customer their space. A friend of mine felt that way. Hence 3/5 for service. Food: Galuti kabab and Mutton Nihari of this place is amazing. It has potential to be in top 10 of Singapore. But their biryani sucked. A complete waste of appetite. Overall 4/5 for food. In general, its a nice north indian place which serves good food. Some of these food resembles few dishes from Lucknow. But when you bring in the price point and compare them with other Indian restaurants. You would start to question, should you go back for another meal?",

Perhaps this place once was good (therefore the relatively good review), but it is certainly not now. On top of everything, as if not bad enough, it is also crazily expensive.

Above all the staff members were absolutely courteous and were able to recommend some good food on the menu. My only concern and perhaps the reason which may abstain me from visiting the place again was the kind of food served in an environment which does not support a sizzling hotplate dish. It gives out heavy and spicy smoke effect . Diners sitting on the right and left of my table ordered the sizzler and smoke engulfed the whole place and I ended up having  irritant eyes which began to tear profusely. Unfortunately, I came in for lunch after my eye procedure and one could imagine the discomfort I experienced. I wouldnt mind when such sizzler dishes are served if there is proper exhaust system. Will be good for the restaurant to reconsider serving such dishes in the future. Being a vegetarian I was not comfortable being engulfed in such a smoke environment though! Although I was not fussy about being  doused in that smoke, I should say my clothes smelt bad and it lingered on me. Will be good if the management could be more sensitive to other diners and look into how to serve sizzlers with proper system in place. My heartfelt thanks to the staff members who were fast to react with wet tissues to wipe my eyes off the smoke irritants. Thk you again.",

Suffice to say that Awadh s food was outstanding enough for its taste to linger well past 3 months. To someone jaded by the typical  north indian  food on offer in Singapore, Awadh delivers a shot of exuberant zing to the palate, with the food we ordered (recommended by the maitre d Arjan) hitting all the right notes. The Subz Galawat Kabab, Zaffrani Paneer Tikka, Bhatti Ka Murg and Subz Biriyani - all made for a meal most memorable. Apple Jalebi lives up to its exotic name - a superb finish to an outstanding meal. Skip the drinks unless you re in a mood to indulge. And we hope Awadh finds a larger, perhaps standalone unit, where its food and service can truly shine.",

Cold and oily and not at all worth the price they are charging. I ordered 2 curries, the paneer one had barely one piece of paneer and the kofta had one piece of kofta for a price of approx SGD 15 each item. I have had much better food at places with less hype.",

Except the sides, the rest of the food we ordered almost tasted the same and smells the same flavor , even the deserts. The highlight was even the basic kadhai paneer didnt taste well here and the naan we ordered was not at all fresh and it was too hard . Just like previous day naan preserved and toasted.. The price was damn expensive for such a small portion. I am surprised to see good reviews on the taste of the food here.. . The total was 110$ for such small portions and only the sides tasted well here that too, its limited to 3 pieces while u get a good portion in other michelin star restaurants. Wasted our money here.

After going inside, we came to know that its a one Thali (plate) where 2 people can share. It contains some 10 varieties of curries including sweet and curd  in a very limited quantity (very less for 2) and contains 1 naan (very small size) with some rice. (photo attached) Honestly, the quantity is not justified for 2 pax. Moreover the taste was very normal and nothing exclusive. I would really not like to go again for this much cost and for this less quantity. It clearly seemed to be a cheating where they want the people coming to order explicitly something extra because the quantity is not enough for 2 persons. They should actually mention this on internet about this. Lets say, if you are going officially or with the office colleague, how could you expect to share the plate. On top of this, they would be forcing you to order something from their menu like drinks and kebabs.",

Unfortunately my second visit really disappointed me. I went back to this place on 14th feb which happens to be our anniversary as well. Since my husbamd is from lucknow i wanted to get some close to home taste. After we sat down we were informed that only set menus are available and it was 70$ per person. Since we alrdy reserved the place we went ahead with the set menu. I was surprised to find the food quality to be just average and in the main course it was chicken biriyani with some regular paneer n daal with egg gravy. None of the dishes delighted our taste buds. Since we cudnt even finish it we asked them to pack the food, and then came the second surprise - we hav to pay 10$ for packing. I mean where on earth ppl charge for packing when they hav already charged for the food. After some argument and unnecessary discussion we got that 10$ waived but it spoilt the mood for the rest of the day. We wud hav happily paid had the food taste and quality were really good. I myself recommended this place to several ppl, but m sad to say that i m never going to go back to awadh n neither u would recommend to anyone. You have let us down big time!",

From the very first meeting with Ms Manisha and Mr Amitabh, we were blown away by their warmth and hospitality! Firstly, the ambience of the restaurant is amazing, what with the pretty chandeliers and all. Secondly, the food is wonderful! The way everything comes together is a tantalising treat for the Taste buds. Finally, the service is exceptional! They are very humble and attentive and helpful and they were so accommodating to our ideas and wishes and when we marched in that evening, we were so amazed at how everything had turned out. Its pretty scary to have had to plan a reception, albeit a small one but with so many restrictions, what with the pandemic and all, but everything was so smooth and effortless and we didnt have to worry as everything was well taken care of! After the reception, all our guests sang praises about the quality and taste of the food. Everyone enjoyed it immensely! They enjoyed the ambience, the food and how accommodating and quick the staff were. We are truly so deeply grateful to everyone at Awadh for having us and for enabling us to have a wonderful reception and most importantly for taking such wonderful care of our guests! In spite of the pandemic and restrictions, we were able to have a wonderful reception and we are truly blessed and thankful because for that day we truly felt like royalty! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!",

                        "review_text": "Most of the food was not fresh or tastefully prepared for the price. The cottage cheese (paneer) was definitely far from fresh, the texture of the samosa showed its age, the roti and naan were sub-par and just a couple of the dishes we ordered were any good. You can get far better and fresher food at lower prices and consistent quality at places like Zaffron kitchen or the Indian curry house. Will definitely not recommend this restaurant. (update on 19 Jan 2021) Both my wife and I came down with a severe reaction after this meal. Had to rush her to hospital early this morning. I felt slightly ill but recovered faster.",

It s listed as a Royal fine dining place. The dishes were homely and tasty with just the right portion. There were quite a variety of vegetarian options. Starter: We tried the Fauladi Kebab and Paneer Kathi Roll. Both were quite good. The Kebab came with a green chutney with its nice spicy flavour. Main Course: We went for the Kadai Paneer and Lehsuni Motiya Palak. The Kadai Paneer is spicy while the Palak dish is rich and creamy. They complement well with any bread (Naan or Roti) and balance your palette. Dessert: Phirni comes in 2 flavours Malai Phirni was particularly the winner of the desert lot. It comes in another flavour of rose milk. In conclusion it was delightful dinner for us. The prices are comparatively on the higher side but seems okay for the taste and outcome of dishes.",

I d start by sharing that their food is delirious. What we ordered was : Bhatti Ka Murgh, Gosht Galawat Kebab, Ulte Tawe Ka Paratha, Murgh Seekh Kebab, Murgh Chandi Tikka, Mutton Biryani, Butter Chicken, Dal E Khas, Rumali Roti, Cheese Naan, Garlic Naan, Magaj Naan. Their food is finger licking good. Amitabh who is the owner deserves a special mention here because we were to host certain set of folks and we needed a solid recommendation and wanted the chef to make the food with extra love. The food totally lived up to our expectations. Once you get to speak to Amitabh, you would know he is such a kind person and has some great suggestions to make. The staff Anjali and Neha are quite smart and patient too. Before finalising the menu, we spoke to Neha and she has a very calm demeanour. Just when she thought we were going a little overboard with ordering the food, she did not even hesitate to tell us that we might waste it, if we order more. How nice of her! :) They also sent us Milai Phirni which was a complimentary dish! Their food is so good that we literally went into food coma. I would highly recommend this place to you. Go book it now and I am sure you d come back wanting for more!",

Prices are exuberant, food is not tasty and definitely not worth the money. Any average restaurant is way better than TheAwad. Staff were ok but definitely food needs to be improvised.

Yea I get it that maybe a lot of hard work and spices were in them, but really couldn t stomach the price tag. The broccoli appetizer is kind of special, first time seeing broccoli cooked this way, and it taste good. Food is definitely delicious especially the Naan, but will I come back again?

There was really nothing special about the menu and service and food quality were far below expectations. Firstly, the staff took a fairly long time to give us menus and take our orders although it was a weekday and restaurant was running at half capacity. The waiters were not attentive and lacked the knowledge about the menu so that we could make our choices. Next, the food took an inordinate amount of time to arrive although it was a set meal - considering most dishes would be pre-prepared. The food arrived cold, only the naans were hot - we guessed that took time. The gulab jamun was cold and hard and none of us had more than a bite. The basmati rice was just a plain pilau - did not match the fancy name stated in the menu. Would give this place a one star if not for the saving grace - the buttermilk as an aperitif at the start was perfect and refreshing for a hot day. Just wished the staff were more active and genuine about attending to the customers. Maybe the main menu would have been much more appetising but it will take me some time before I try this place again as Ive had much better Indian food for equally priced meals.",

So I was super excited to learn a restaurant attempting to showcase the cuisine of Awadh has opened here. I went with low expectations, because even in India, getting good Awadhi food outside Lucknow is very hard. I was very pleasantly surprised I must confess. The owner and his wife are from the state, and the chef is from the city, which definitely shows in the food. We tried the Galawati (translates to melt in your mouth) kebab, which is the acid test of any Awadhi restaurant. Ive not had this good a kebab outside of India. It is a tricky dish to get right, with a lot of spices going in to get it right. We also tried the Thali, which had a variety of chicken, lamb and veggie dishes, all with their unique flavors standing out (a very hard thing to do as most indian restaurants take a short cut and put everything in similar gravies). The dessert of rose phrini was also excellent. I will be back for sure. Give this place a try and experience an unique side of Indian cuisine which isnt easily available outside of the city of Lucknow these days!",

I am a big fan of awadh cuisine having spent many years in Lucknow and was really excited to try this new restaurant whose claim to fame is Lucknowi cuisine. The galawati kebab and kalmi kebab were very nicely recreated. The taste was very close to the original. Thoroughly enjoyed the starters including the paneer wrap. The chicken korma was to the point and really good too. However, the dish that we were most excited about disappointed the most. The highlight of Awadhi cuisine is the Lucknowi biriyani of the likes of Idris and Ishtiyaque. Sadly the biriyani was normal Singaporean indian restaurant biriyani with yellow rice and chicken. The chef was so lazy that birista (fried onion) was the prepackaged dry one and not freshly prepared. The aromatics Lucknowi biriyani is known for were completely absent. Ambience is very basic as well as the service and prices are a tad bit high for the overall experience . I would recommend galawati kebab and korma.  Steer clear of the biriyani.",

The preset thali took around 1hour  arrive. The serving staff was clueless. Few tables around us cancelled the orders and left as well as they couldn t wait. How can a preselected menu of thali take so long to arrive when nearly all tables are pre-reserved? The excuse was that they prepare the food fresh but after the 1 hour wait, food served was cold/luke warm at best. I wish the food was worth the wait but that a massive disappointment as well. How can you serve such sub-standard food and charge fine dining prices. The mutton was just salty and flavourless, chicken was like that from a ordinary Food court. The gulab jamun was hard and straight out from a supermarket can.  The only 1 item was good was the kebab. Everything else was what you would get at a substandard Indian stall at a food court. Need to  get  your act together guys. Most of the 5 reviews seem to be fake as this was easily the worst Indian meal in my 10 years in Singapore.",

                        "review_text": "Dear Folks & Dear Awadh Restaurant, This review is only for Galawat Kebab; As for other dishes people have already shared experiences that may vary person to person depending on their roots; their perception towards Awadh cuisine; and a first time tryer or a regular one. For people, especially Lucknowites like me who have tasted Galawat Kebab in Tunday and Dastarkhwan, it is my humble request please dont compare their Kebabs to the ones you will taste in Awadh, else you will be heartbroken. Those ones are mouthwatering juicy, very tender, carry a certain tickle and taste that cant be described, hence they are Galawat in truest sense. The ones you get to taste here are more like a dry version of those which wont have that juiceness, a bit more hard textured, and the authenticity or the tickle you will not find. As evident from the photo itself, you can judge the difference. I ordered Kebabs from this restaurant only after my research getting to know the history behind and therefore I had certain expectations. But after trying these, I realized have to wait another 6-8 months before I travel Lucknow. For other folks, I hope they will like these Kebabs :) I am not sure if this falls under any improvement space upon the restaurant since its a very delicate dish, but as someone who was rooting and feeling proud to finally find a restaurant in Singapore that can serve those authentic Galawat Kebabs all the way from Lucknow, I felt a bit disappointed and therefore this long review. Nevertheless, I wish Awadh best of luck in their success. -Vivek",

The mutton biryani is the favourite - really well done and mutton pieces were tender. The veg kebab truly melts in your mouth, dont doubt the description in the menu! The dal is one of the best we have had in a long time, thick and flavours were just right. The saffron dessert was also fantastic to end the meal! Overall the food wasnt too salty nor oily, but full of flavor and taste is pretty authentic. In addition, delivery was later than promised so they gave us complimentary naan and rose dessert. Gotta say its great customer recovery!! Would love to visit the restaurant for a dine in experience once this circuit breaker is over!",

We had no waiting between emptying our plates as we gobbled up the appetizers to having the next plate delivered. The decor is inviting.

The staff was really attentive and gave us thoughtful suggestions for our meal, given that we were all vegetarians. The food was freshly prepared, delicately flavoured and subtly spiced capturing the fine nuances of Awadhi cuisine. Our vegetarian galouti kababs were delectable paired well with ulte tawe ka parantha recommended by the staff and the garlic naan was one of the best we had in recent times. All in all, a great addition to Singapore s Indian dining scene.",

The kebabs made in the old Mughalii tradition, melt in the mouth! The gravy dishes are made to perfection, each one with it s own flavours and aromas! Even the dessert was excellent and cooked as it should be - original authentic taste! My husband and I loved the food so much that in our 14 days stay in Singapore, we visited the restaurant thrice! The live indian music, nostalgic and wonderful, added to our wonderful experience and enjoyment! We shall soon return and look forward to savouring the fantastic Mughlai food again at Avadh ! All the best to Avadh for success in the future so we can keep visiting you and treating ourselves to your exquisite cuisine! Gopi and Ashwani Sharma",

Their signature dish, Galawat Kebabs were SO disappointing.. Not only was the presentation below average, but the portions were laughable.. We got 5 measly (smaller than bite sized) pieces.. Cannot describe the taste as it felt like a small bite of kebab that gets over before it touches your tongue!! 2. The servers seemed very confused.. We did not have 1 particular server for our table.. And each server had their own answers to the same questions we were asking. 3. We waited for a really long time for our food only to realise it is going to different tables and our biryani was even served to a plate on a different table! Only to see the server taking it back.. Roaming around with it all over the place and getting it to our table after a good 10 minutes.. Cold, obviously! 4. The ambience was good but it was the last thing on my mind when I left the place! 5. Is it a bad idea to go to a place which has opened up 2 weeks ago? I understand teething troubles but in every aspect?? 6. Found out that the owners were sitting right outside the restaurant - Why? You guys should be sitting inside watching how your staff is getting everything wrong, overselling drinks and alcohol, making us wait and then serving the wrong tables.. Sitting outside defeats the purpose since you ll only hear biased stories from the staff.. This place has great potential if executed right! But for me, not coming back again (for now)",

Gravies are mainly paneer oriented & this keeps your taste buds to only taste paneer. DONT order Tandoori roti, it was 25% cooked. 3. The worst part was the so called LIVE PERFORMANCE. The sound was blaring & if your with your family you cant even talk to each other because of this noise. The setting was very badly organized. Moreover the performer & staff were very rude & inconsiderate that we requested them thrice to reduce the volume because we had a child sleeping and a pregnant lady & yet they refused to reduce the volume too. 4. A bit highly priced for that variety but wirth for the quality. 5. On the whole, if you want to taste the food better TAKE AWAY or HOME DELIVERY because service was very very poor & the noise is very annoying not letting you to enjoy your meal. The management must consider to improve the service & change the performance to a very pleasing one.",
