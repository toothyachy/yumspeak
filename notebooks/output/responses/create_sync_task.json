I ended up falling in love with this place and will definitely come back again.\n\nTo start off, the desserts lived up to my expectations. For you sweet tooth lovers out there, this is the perfect place for you. Got 4 different types of cake (Raspberry, Lemon Pound Cake, Pistachios & Carrot Cake) and their signature \u201cYou Tiao\u201d which were their Pandan churros. Some might say it\u2019s too sweet for their liking, but it\u2019ll be a perfect option for sharing.\n\nAdditionally, their cocktails and coffee got us hooked. Versatile menu & a wide range of liquor to choose from. What makes them unique is their Signature Cocktails where you can find every bit of sweet, sour, salty and spicy to each their own.\nI ordered a Garden\u2019s Party, a sweet and refreshing drink consisting of Sprite, Gin and different variations of floral notes.\n\nThe HIGHLIGHT of the night were their live band happening every Friday night from 7.15pm onwards alllll the way till 10pm.\nThey set the tone and ambience for the night, an experienced band while engaging the audience. Kudos to them, they were my favourite thing of my night.\n\nWill definitely come back here again, and recommend you to come here with your loved ones :)",

Try their grill octopus, grill half chicken. Both are very flavourful and tastefully seasoned. Price surprisingly is lower than I expected for such place and service. Their service is also top notched.\n\nTheir service staff keep ensuring us that there are preparing the outdoor seating for us so that we don\u2019t waited too long. (It was raining and they are drying the seat for us). Yes it\u2019s pet friendly too! I will defiantly come back for another visit.\n\nFood: Great flavours\nService: Awesome (attentive)\nAmbient: Great outdoor\nPet friendly: Yes\nPrice: Reasonable\nWorth Second Visit: Yes\nWorth Recommending: Yes",

Despite reserving a table for two, we were given a small one that could barely accommodate our appetizers, let alone the main dishes of pizza, mac & cheese, and fries we ordered. We had to relocate to a larger table, which wasnt problematic, but the real issue arose when our food arrived over 40 minutes after ordering. This delay was due to the wifi being down, which prevented our order from reaching the kitchen. This issue went unnoticed until we observed neighboring tables receiving their orders promptly. Prior to this, we had already changed tables once due to space constraints caused by neighboring diners.

I ended up falling in love with this place and will definitely come back again. To start off, the desserts lived up to my expectations. For you sweet tooth lovers out there, this is the perfect place for you. Got 4 different types of cake (Raspberry, Lemon Pound Cake, Pistachios & Carrot Cake) and their signature  You Tiao  which were their Pandan churros. Some might say it s too sweet for their liking, but it ll be a perfect option for sharing. Additionally, their cocktails and coffee got us hooked. Versatile menu & a wide range of liquor to choose from. What makes them unique is their Signature Cocktails where you can find every bit of sweet, sour, salty and spicy to each their own. I ordered a Garden s Party, a sweet and refreshing drink consisting of Sprite, Gin and different variations of floral notes. The HIGHLIGHT of the night were their live band happening every Friday night from 7.15pm onwards alllll the way till 10pm. They set the tone and ambience for the night, an experienced band while engaging the audience. Kudos to them, they were my favourite thing of my night. Will definitely come back here again, and recommend you to come here with your loved ones :) Parking: Limited number of slots. Wheelchair accessibility: However, do take note this is not an elderly friendly area, have to climb a flight of stairs and upslope to reach the place.",

He very warmly welcomed us, patiently introduced to us to dishes and the history of the cocktails ($20 & $22) that we ve ordered, and also followed up with us after the meal. I ordered soft shell Chili crab pasta ($29) and Angus steak ($32). Crab was very flavorful, umami, and crispy; there was a generous amount of crab meat in the sauce. It also had the spicy kick that I enjoyed. The angus steak? Not so much. Overall flavor was ok but the meat was slightly tough. Didn t enjoy it at all. Initially I wondered what the fuss was about from other reviews about the service, and boy did they live up to expectations. Would prolly not patronize again, if not for Lu Fei. Thank you for making our experience so enjoyable.",

We had the pulled pork pizza, curly fries and Har Jeong burger (a tad bit too salty for me). The indoor seating of the bar is a bit cold but the service staff Raj was nice enough to let us seat at a nice place that is not too cold. After the meal, we told Raj that it was the first time we were at the Alkaff Mansion and he showed us around and even explained some of the history of the place to us. Thank you for going the extra mile and the wonderful experience! Your company is lucky to have you. The place has nice and chill vibes, but isn t really accessible if you don t drive. Even with driving, climbing up the flight of stairs would require a great amount of effort for elderlies. This would be a place of consideration for events if there were lifts for elderlies.",

We also got complimentary cocktails which were strawberry flavored (really delicious). We come here because of the food - one of the best Ive had in Singapore. The Peranakan appetizer was delicious, but the highlight was the truffle carbonara and Laksa prawn rolls. The carbonara was not heavy just perfectly creamy. The laksa rolls were a bit spicy but balanced with the mayo. Their cakes are really good quality! Recommend the pistachio pear cake and carrot cake.",

Place of food is good, finished plates are swapped with next order and we did not feel a time where we were waiting. Service is attentive and courteous.

Nevertheless, Raj and Lu Fei are very friendly. They treated us a free slice of carrot cake as we went there for a birthday celebration! Thumbs up for the service! Atmosphere wise, the ambience is peaceful and retro but the aircond was way too cold. Please bring along a jacket if you want to stay for more than an hor.",

Loved the outdoor ambience; loved the attentive service; loved that there was a live band who performed excellently. We probably order 75% of the items on the food menu and all of them were good, no complaints at all food-wise. They have 1-for-1 (like-for-like) corkage policy, which I made use of to open a top drop. TXA gave us a complimentary piece of cheesecake for the celebration, with the live band singing the birthday song. It was a unforgettable evening. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to have a semi-casual and really fun celebration.",

Based on the information on the sign-up page, there was supposed to be 18 exhibitors showcasing their wines from 6 - 9 pm. When I arrived, there were only 4 booths set up at 7 pm. This is a massive farce from your advertisement. Kindly refund me my money in full, if not you can prorate it based on the 4 booths that were set up.

Their service is also top notched. Their service staff keep ensuring us that there are preparing the outdoor seating for us so that we don t waited too long. (It was raining and they are drying the seat for us). Yes it s pet friendly too! I will defiantly come back for another visit.

The pork was really good and nice juice as well. However, the steak was really bad and dry. I asked for medium rare but came well done. Food was cold when it came! Literally cold steak and pork. Service was very slow but I saw that they have a ton of service crew?!?! The person who took my order ask if I want to have my dessert served later, but when I wanted to have the dessert, they told me i didnt order any. Probably will only come back and order a dri k for the ambience.",

My family had so much fun. Thank you, Ram, for the service! And also the other young Indian gentleman who was so conscientious about keeping our waters filled. We went on 12 Mar.

Not the first time I have been here; and I like the closeness to nature and the fact it s actually just 15 mins leisurely walk away from the closest bus stop (don t believe if its says its less than 10) Sit outside if the weather is not too hot and windy. On certain nights they have the BBQ option - we tasted a few BBQ dishes from the menu and it was pretty decent. If you have a group of friends, my tip is to get a few starters/ appetizers, get a few BBQ dishes and share them all. The beef angus steak is pretty good, the grilled peppers were my favorite and the grilled octopus was pretty fantastic! For the drinks, beside the beer - the Mexican-type sangria (sorry I forgot the name) is my favorite. Price is a bit on the high side - the grilled vegetable is quite a small portion with main dish prices.",

The service was horrible, they explained they were under staffed.. the food arrived cold, order fried croquettes that was def sitting there for loooong time before being served and no cutlery and plates. On my dish that had 3 components, came only with 2.. Was chaos! Only 2 tables were being well served, probably related to owner.. all the rest was very upset. They claimed to have a bday desert, that we never got. By end of dinner, we just wanted to leave this place!

However, it seems the service is getting progressively worse each time we visit. I booked yesterday for mothers Day. In the morning, they called to confirm the reservation, and I specified we wanted an outdoor table. That evening, after ordering, they suddenly told us that we had to move indoors due to a wedding. (Didnt they know about the wedding when they called me that morning?) Aside from that, they are VERY slow. It took 30 minutes and 3 reminders for my son to get a drink. Staff all seem to be confused and not know what they are doing. All in all, a very strange mothers Day experience. We ended up just having drinks and not bothering to stay for dinner at all.",

It was the most abysmal Restaurant Week (actually scratch that, any restaurant encounter) experience - and the fact that I chose it for one of my rare nights out with my SO drove me to write this even this has happened weeks ago! CONS 1) Servicing was almost non-existent: When we were seated, one of the lead waiters (?, Judging by the outfit) expected us to decide what to order from the e-menu mere minutes after being seated. We needed time and indicated so. It took us so long after go get the attention of anyone who would take our order. This was going to be a recurring pattern throughout the night - as we often had to ask and ask again to check where our drinks were (our order of a can of Coke took much longer to arrive than our appetizer), I think I also asked for my bill three times - the last time I just walked straight up to the front. The lead waiter that did take our order didnt really seem interested in making recommendations. Despite us ordering from the RW menu, he recommended the exact appetizer that was already in the RW menu. When I asked if they served ribs, he must have also forgotten that it was in the special menu until I saw it minutes after placing my order. The table next to us that was having a birthday party seemed to get more attention than us, so maybe we werent too interesting for the lead waiter? Who knows 2) Food was average to poor, for the price that was being charged. Forget about plating/ food presentation because there was no effort in that department. The place labels itself as a Spanish joint, but that was probably overstating: Everything was forgettable and mostly bland tasting, with the exception of the deep fried croquette balls and something else with Roquefort cheese (sorry, the experience was so bad I didnt even want to remember the details). The beef cheek was OK and the ribs were horribly bland. The dessert was forgettable. Cocktails were diluted and took forever (see comment above) to arrive. Perhaps it isnt fair to comment on presentation, but I was coming here with the mindset that it was part of RW. The appetizer, while delicious, was literally placed in a plate of lettuce and cheese that any kid could have done in 5 mins. PROS: The ambience. Long story short: Come for the ambience, but dont expect decent servicing or even decent food despite the prices that theyre charging.",

Similar for the carabinero prawns. I d come back for drinks and perhaps other dishes but you re better off steering clear of the calamari and prawns.

Was pouring heavily and stuck at the roadside under a parasol, then came a waitress who carried umbrellas down the stairs to pass it to us. Chicken wings was crisp, steak was tender and the truffle brie pizza was flavorful. Would recommend the truffle pizza over the burrata pizza as the latter didt taste out of the ordinary. Portion given was more than enough too. Ambiance was great and service was very attentive, did not even need to ask for a refill of water as the waiters and waitresses are faster than me.

Its a bit disappointing that Txa is selling themselves as a Pintxo restaurant but the Pintxo section is only a small subset of their whole menu (only 7 Pintxo items). I was expecting more. Its also a bit odd that they serve burgers, pasta and pizza (we didnt try these). I see the pdf menu file says Reduced - hopefully they can bring the original menu as intended. The restaurants vibe is a bit odd as well and it did not say Pintxos restaurant. Maybe im nitpicking but even the music is a bit out of place - party/club music. The bar in the middle of the restaurant was also out of place. I guess the intention was to have the spread of Pintxos on the bar but given COVID situation, its not really ideal to have it there. Service was ok. We didnt experience any delays on the food. It was just unfortunate that the servers dropped and broke a lot of things (e.g. plates, cups) that day.",

The service was the real highlight of the evening, really enjoyed the hospitable service provided by the two young staff that mainly attended to us, unfortunately I only could get the name of one of them, Geri. She was really attentive and highly energetic, it made me feel like she genuinely enjoyed her work and I felt very comfortable. The manager also provided us with a free cheesecake for my girlfriend s birthday and that was greatly appreciated. Would definitely come again!",

The waiter attending to us mentioned he is from the restaurant UNA upstairs and he was just helping out at TXA. He claimed doesn t know the menu at TXA hence he was unable to answer our queries. We were hoping he would direct his colleague who knows the menu to us but all we got was a blank stare and an awkward silence. So awkward that we decided not to pursue it, give the benefit of the doubt and just order the food. (Food turned out so so, average) The food we ordered was meant for sharing and every time a stack of plates with cutlery were placed on our table. Not once did any staff took the initiative to lay the plates and cutlery out for us, it was always just a stack laid out at the corner of the table. The table was very unstable as well. It is hard to enjoy a meal while trying to balance the table and hope nothing falls off. Unless the management works on staff training and investing in sturdier dining tables for patrons, not worth a visit there.",

As our staff were engaged with other tables, a staff member from UNA s team noticed your table and attended to you in the meantime. We sincerely apologise that he was not able to provide menu recommendations due to his designation at UNA. Additionally, we hope that your dining experience was made a little better after our staff replaced the shaky table. Please rest assured that we have conveyed your feedback to our team and once again, we would like to extend our sincere regret that we were unable to provide you the best possible experience at TXA.

Drinks - All of us had preferences on our drinks and the bartenders personally attended to us and made excellent drinks. The 2 cocktails I had here were better than some of the best cocktail bars in Singapore. Food - We had the Chicken wings , Mushroom Croquettes and Truffle pizza. All dishes were great. Service - 10/10 for service. Right from when we arrived to the time we left we felt fully taken care of. Ambience is the best highlight. This is also a pet friendly place and my puppy loved being here. Will come by again. Thanks for a great evening.",

The atmosphere was really good, nice music in the background, temperature was just right even for outdoor, with a little breeze now and then. We had a few tapas and bar snacks to start with. Love the presentation of each dish. Honey paprika wings were the unexpected highlight!! Full of umami flavors from roasted sesame & seaweed. Finger licking good We were also impressed by the beef short rib dish, having literally melt-in-your-mouth kind of texture, going so well with the dipping sauce on the side. I would recommend to go with truffle mushroom for the pizza, forget the prawn & scallop as it was quite bland.. at least the truffle cream was satisfying with every bite. Overall, a very nice & cosy place for family & friends gathering, even a romantic date would be appropriate. Price wise, not cheap but reasonable I would say! Not forgetting to mention, their service crews were really well trained. Thumbs up.",

It felt like the floor crew did not communicate with one another. Food was first served without any cutleries as well. But the food was delicious so it made up for the lack in service. Then Ram (I hope I got his name right) started serving us and he completely changed the service game thereon. He was attentive, friendly, and patient.

Great ambiance too, due to nicely set up lighting. Food was very good although in itself nothing to rave about. Good selection of pintxos and other small dishes as well as bigger mains. Nicely done and presented. Staff nice, attentive and flexible. Was sometimes hard to grab their attention as the space is quite big and we were sat at the end of the terrace, which meant that we had to keep trying, but when they did see us they were great.",

We asked her if they are selling cigarettes at the restaurant and they said didn t sell, then unexpectedly she offered her own cigarette to us.

We had sauteed mushroom with sous vide egg (recommended!), grilled padron peppers & paprika chicken wings. The happy hour drinks at 2 for 1 was a good deal. The burnt cheesecake was good though it was more of a soft cotton texture rather than gooey center. Churros was crunchy outside and fluffy inside. Mains were all good value below $30. Overall, very pleasant outdoors, with big fan and distance from other tables. Will visit again.",

                        "review_text": "Regrettable choice, with extremely dissatisfying service, small selection of average quality food. Ive planned to attend the Semana Grande event and to catch up with a few friends and to celebrate one of my friends birthday last night but it was so bad I actually felt ashamed to have celebrated my friends birthday there last night. The service was terrible starting from the moment we sat down, as the compound was quite big we had no clue where our table was and the hostess told us to go look for our friends ourselves who were already in the courtyard. One seated no one came to welcome us, if anything I felt quite unwelcome already by then. Then, we had to desperately get the attention of our service staff whom we later found out was called Ram (While leaving we asked him for his name and actually was trying to hide his name and asked us if we were looking for his manager instead). We decided to take a start off our night with some beers and Ram came to take the order but actually sniggered at us when he left with our order of 3 half pints of beer. I mean that was just uncalled for, but I decided to let it pass since i thought i might have heard wrong but later on in the evening it just got worse each time we made subsequent orders of pintxos, mains and beers , he would leave shaking his head in disappointment as though we were not ordering enough. What made me decide to write this review was that after we have paid for our bill and asked Ram for a refill of our glasses of water, he told us alright but actually went to the open bar and signalled to his colleague to not fill our glasses up. A quick look at some of the recent reviews claims that Rams service was immaculate and perfect which i couldnt help but wonder if Ram is capable of such great service then why were we treated in such a manner that makes us feel like we were discriminated. The other service staff were also very disorganised and Im sure it had nothing to do with being short staffed as the courtyard was barely full. When we placed our orders with other staff they would get Ram to come and re-confirm our orders and yet they would serve us dishes which we did not order (which was later included in our bill). We also experienced extremely varied waiting times for our food and beverages, we could be served almost instantly or have to wait for upwards of 15 minutes for some dishes. It almost felt like we could not dine in peace, let alone celebrate our friends birthday. The saving grace was when we spoke to one of their event staff about how terrible the service was considering it was an event + our friends birthday she proposed to give us a small discount at the end of the night. The food was a hit and miss, the mains were alright but considering it is a pintxo bar, which I would believe is the main point of going there, the pintxo selection was ridiculously small with only 5 options available. Prices are on the high side for what its worth. Im guessing theres much work to be done for this establishment and until then I will not advise anyone to dine there nor dine there personally.",

Not sure if it s because of  mass produce  since this is restaurant week menu, the pintxos aren t fresh. Breads taste stale. Beef is  hard to bite . And the waiters while friendly, are unattentive. Eg bringing in the birthday cake while half of the table went to washroom, and unable to answer simple questions on the drinks. I think the servers are just overwhelmed. There are lots of room for improvement both food and service wise. Sadly for now, I don t think I ll recommend my friends nor revisit anytime soon.",

                        "review_text": "The worst dinner I ve ever had in Singapore fell on Valentines day. Our table was booked for 8:30 pm. We reached around 8:20 pm and saw numerous couples standing around, waiting for a seat like a hawker center. We waited for more than half an hour standing since the waiting area was packed, and there were not enough seats. Everyone had to try their best entertaining each other because it is a special day otherwise I would not be surprised if someone started a riot. It was obvious that the issue was the restaurant being severely understaffed. There was only one person at the counter and another running around, directing people to their seats. Very disorganized. There was no queue number or any sort of queue to begin with. People could only stand around and pray to all the gods that they would be called next because no one had any clue who came first. After observing the whole situation, we decided to stay near the counter instead of walking outside to avoid the crowd. Luckily, we were randomly asked to go in after 30 mins of wating. I wonder those poor souls who waited further away from the counter (understandably since it was very crowded) probably had to wait longer. The menu was a standard Valentines menu, we only had one choice to make - main course. But I guess they thought we needed half an hour to decide or nobody seemed to care if we had ordered or not. After awkwardly trying to get attention from multiple staff, someone finally decided to take our order. It took 30 mins for the appetiser to come. The portion was very small - it took us more time to instagram it than eat it. Saving grace is, it tasted decent. 10 mins later our cocktails came but from there everything went from bad to worse. Throughout the time in there, staff were constantly asking what did we order for main course. Not sure they trying to save the earth by not writing it down or what. There are only two freaking options for mains. That means, for each table, you only need to remember two dishes. Pretty sure zi char uncles and aunties can definitely do a better job than this, think they should be hired instead. 10:00 pm we were starving already so we were contemplating about ordering grab food but don t wanna be too disrespectful so we asked how long more. 4 - 5 mins, that was the answer. 10:15 pm we realised by now that our innocent souls got tricked. Such a stupid thing to do. If we ordered McDonald s we might have a better Valentines dinner by now. Never mind that 5 minutes later, another staff came in, we were expecting a good news but it turned out:  what main course did you order ah? . Seriously? At first I thought my dinner was tragedy but it was a comedy. It just became funny at this point. I started questioning about life and suffering. I heard life is nothing by false hope and liars, I guess that s true. 10:23 pm we finally got our main. TWO HOURS after we reached here. And we spent 2 mins finishing that miserable little steak jajajjajahahahhaha. 10:32 pm the dessert was unfashionably fast to be served judging from their standard. Probably their new record timing here. 10:40pm we left the place hungry and disappointed. Proceeded to my gf house for a maggi mee. That s probably the best thing that night. Thank you TXA for making me realised that true joy doesn t need to be as expensive as your dinner menu. Just one humble suggestion, if you don t have enough staff, please don t ruin people s special day by operating at this substandard. You don t need to pay me for this suggestion, because you probably paid it with your brand reputation.",

We made a reservation for 8:30pm, and showed up at 8:45pm and sat at around 8:50pm. From there, I felt like I had entered a parallel universe where everything that could go wrong did. The whole operation was amiss. The staff especially had no idea what was going on. We waited 1.5 hours to get our food, at which point we suddenly got all our courses at the same time. This is where I m adding 2 additional stars for the very nice bottle of wine they comped us, since at this point we were one of the last tables remaining and still hadn t gotten our food. But I m subtracting 1 because, in a turn of events, they chased us down as we were leaving to ask us to pay. I feel incredibly sorry for the significant others who went out of their way to book and prepay this 3 course dinner. And even more sorry for anyone on their first date. In sum, I would probably advise you to do your due diligence before coming and consider avoiding for special occasions.",

When I arrived at 6.15pm (seating was at 6pm), staff were still scrambling to place flowers on the table. Front desk staff asked us to proceed in but the service staff asked us to wait to be seated. It was clear that both teams were extremely unprepared. Next, a waiter came around asking how we would like our beef to be cooked (we had a choice between beef and fish). I was utterly shocked. Isn t the staff supposed to ask if we want fish or beef first? So rude and ill trained. Waited for more than an HOUR for the first course to arrive. Even then, the staff were extremely unsure on who they had already served and they comically tried to give the same table 2 servings. Embarrassing to say the least. Paid huge amounts of money for this dinner and it wasn t worth it at all. Drinks were bad, food was average, service was even worse. Will never come back ever again.",

Very polite person spoke to me on the phone but just said they were sorry and essentially blamed me. I know that I never called to cancel or cancelled through Chope on my phone. At minimum, really poor communication and no attempt to value a customer s reservations made online. They took the easy route, cancelled our place without actually talking to me, all for the sake of getting another customer. Felt greedy and transactional. We won t bring our business here.",

The complimentary nachos and cheese are Latin American in origin, not Spanish. The Estrella beer keg must ve been old as it had gone sour. For some bizarre reason, despite hand picking the cold pinxto dishes buffet style, guests are not allowed to bring it back to the table with us, but instead entrust the sever to ferry it. Was it to add on plating garnish? No. There is simply no logical explanation for this process. Additionally, this adds an opportunity for mistake for the evidently inexperienced staff to bring it to another table while we, who had arrived earlier, sat at a table devoid of our both our drinks and food orders as well as plates and cutlery. The grilled dishes came out before the cold which were lukewarm and sans char/grill marks. The dishes were both saturated with sweetness, devoid of the acidity and freshness characteristic to Spanish food. The octopus, concurring with an earlier review, tasted like bakwa. Finally, 2 out of 4 of our cold pinxto arrived 45mins after we originally picked it out at the counter and they were certainly not worth the wait. A big ball of soft cheese on a piece of toast is unpleasant by all accounts. Out of patience, we asked for the bill and left, feeling disgruntled and cheated at paying $170 for such a horrendous dining experience. Although the staff repeatedly apologized for the delay in getting us the cold pinxto, with so many service errors, it s an empty gesture that felt almost insulting to clearly unhappy customers. Professional restaurants would send a manager to make amends and ask for feedback on how to improve. Instead, the staff timidly avoided our table unless directly beckoned. You can t get me to go back even if you paid me. Edit: Management response on valid bad Google reviews continue to follow a common trend: giving flimsy excuses without fully understanding the situation since they never bothered to get more information from the client and exhibiting a deflection of responsibility.",

The service seems confused even though the place is mostly empty. Our appetizers were served to the wrong table even though there were only 4 tables. We had to wait 30 min to get ours and just canceled the last 2. The Estrella beer on tap was skunky, meaning the keg is getting old.  The octopus wasn t cooked properly. And to make things worse they served tortilla chips with bottled nacho cheese as a free appetizer. This place is a disgrace to Spanish food.",

More effort and thought could have been put into the plating. With an almost 2cm thick pork collar, there was also servings of thick round fries, and purely butterhead with what seems like thousand island dressing, made the whole thing looks very unappetizing. The salad here was just solely huge butterhead leaves with dressing, and that was it. Disappointing. Pisco sour was also not consistent. Ordered the first one and it was good, and so we ordered a second one. This was absolutely disappointing because there was barely the taste of the liquor, but just simple syrup. Towards the end, can smell the bad smell of egg white. The only reason why I gave two stars was because this place was the place we had our wedding lunch years back.",

The food was so-so, but Im mainly taking off points because of the poor service (the management needs to take note of how severely understaffed they are, and buck up on training their servers who are not familiar with the menu at all). The price point isnt great either - we spent about $250 for three including a bottle of wine - but Ive had way better Spanish food elsewhere. We waited very long for the tapas too. They forgot our churros and to their credit, waived the charge for that. I believe it can be improved if they train their staff and improve operations, but with all these factors taken together, I wont be coming back unless something drastic happens.",

Even the 55++ course has enough quantity and satisfaction. More than what I expected. Bottles of wine start at $55++. Although the location is inconvenient, the atmosphere is good and I recommend it. My favorite is the balcony seat facing outside. A restaurant that can be used for various occasions.",

I ended up falling in love with this place and will definitely come back again.\n\nTo start off, the desserts lived up to my expectations. For you sweet tooth lovers out there, this is the perfect place for you. Got 4 different types of cake (Raspberry, Lemon Pound Cake, Pistachios & Carrot Cake) and their signature \u201cYou Tiao\u201d which were their Pandan churros. Some might say it\u2019s too sweet for their liking, but it\u2019ll be a perfect option for sharing.\n\nAdditionally, their cocktails and coffee got us hooked. Versatile menu & a wide range of liquor to choose from. What makes them unique is their Signature Cocktails where you can find every bit of sweet, sour, salty and spicy to each their own.\nI ordered a Garden\u2019s Party, a sweet and refreshing drink consisting of Sprite, Gin and different variations of floral notes.\n\nThe HIGHLIGHT of the night were their live band happening every Friday night from 7.15pm onwards alllll the way till 10pm.\nThey set the tone and ambience for the night, an experienced band while engaging the audience. Kudos to them, they were my favourite thing of my night.\n\nWill definitely come back here again, and recommend you to come here with your loved ones :)",

Try their grill octopus, grill half chicken. Both are very flavourful and tastefully seasoned. Price surprisingly is lower than I expected for such place and service. Their service is also top notched.\n\nTheir service staff keep ensuring us that there are preparing the outdoor seating for us so that we don\u2019t waited too long. (It was raining and they are drying the seat for us). Yes it\u2019s pet friendly too!

We had to relocate to a larger table, which wasnt problematic, but the real issue arose when our food arrived over 40 minutes after ordering. This delay was due to the wifi being down, which prevented our order from reaching the kitchen. This issue went unnoticed until we observed neighboring tables receiving their orders promptly. Prior to this, we had already changed tables once due to space constraints caused by neighboring diners. Despite these challenges, Lu Fei from the staff was remarkably helpful and offered compensation for the inconvenience.

I ended up falling in love with this place and will definitely come back again. To start off, the desserts lived up to my expectations. For you sweet tooth lovers out there, this is the perfect place for you. Got 4 different types of cake (Raspberry, Lemon Pound Cake, Pistachios & Carrot Cake) and their signature  You Tiao  which were their Pandan churros. Some might say it s too sweet for their liking, but it ll be a perfect option for sharing. Additionally, their cocktails and coffee got us hooked. Versatile menu & a wide range of liquor to choose from. What makes them unique is their Signature Cocktails where you can find every bit of sweet, sour, salty and spicy to each their own. I ordered a Garden s Party, a sweet and refreshing drink consisting of Sprite, Gin and different variations of floral notes. The HIGHLIGHT of the night were their live band happening every Friday night from 7.15pm onwards alllll the way till 10pm. They set the tone and ambience for the night, an experienced band while engaging the audience. Kudos to them, they were my favourite thing of my night. Will definitely come back here again, and recommend you to come here with your loved ones :) Parking: Limited number of slots. Wheelchair accessibility: However, do take note this is not an elderly friendly area, have to climb a flight of stairs and upslope to reach the place.",

He very warmly welcomed us, patiently introduced to us to dishes and the history of the cocktails ($20 & $22) that we ve ordered, and also followed up with us after the meal. I ordered soft shell Chili crab pasta ($29) and Angus steak ($32). Crab was very flavorful, umami, and crispy; there was a generous amount of crab meat in the sauce. It also had the spicy kick that I enjoyed. The angus steak? Not so much. Overall flavor was ok but the meat was slightly tough. Didn t enjoy it at all. Initially I wondered what the fuss was about from other reviews about the service, and boy did they live up to expectations. Would prolly not patronize again, if not for Lu Fei. Thank you for making our experience so enjoyable.",

We had the pulled pork pizza, curly fries and Har Jeong burger (a tad bit too salty for me). The indoor seating of the bar is a bit cold but the service staff Raj was nice enough to let us seat at a nice place that is not too cold. After the meal, we told Raj that it was the first time we were at the Alkaff Mansion and he showed us around and even explained some of the history of the place to us. Thank you for going the extra mile and the wonderful experience! Your company is lucky to have you. The place has nice and chill vibes, but isn t really accessible if you don t drive. Even with driving, climbing up the flight of stairs would require a great amount of effort for elderlies. This would be a place of consideration for events if there were lifts for elderlies.",

We also got complimentary cocktails which were strawberry flavored (really delicious). We come here because of the food - one of the best Ive had in Singapore. The Peranakan appetizer was delicious, but the highlight was the truffle carbonara and Laksa prawn rolls. The carbonara was not heavy just perfectly creamy. The laksa rolls were a bit spicy but balanced with the mayo. Their cakes are really good quality! Recommend the pistachio pear cake and carrot cake.",

Loved the outdoor ambience; loved the attentive service; loved that there was a live band who performed excellently. We probably order 75% of the items on the food menu and all of them were good, no complaints at all food-wise. They have 1-for-1 (like-for-like) corkage policy, which I made use of to open a top drop. TXA gave us a complimentary piece of cheesecake for the celebration, with the live band singing the birthday song. It was a unforgettable evening. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to have a semi-casual and really fun celebration.",

Based on the information on the sign-up page, there was supposed to be 18 exhibitors showcasing their wines from 6 - 9 pm. When I arrived, there were only 4 booths set up at 7 pm. This is a massive farce from your advertisement. Kindly refund me my money in full, if not you can prorate it based on the 4 booths that were set up. I have never attended a wine event where there is such a huge misrepresentation. Terrible experience.",

Their service is also top notched. Their service staff keep ensuring us that there are preparing the outdoor seating for us so that we don t waited too long. (It was raining and they are drying the seat for us). Yes it s pet friendly too! I will defiantly come back for another visit.

The pork was really good and nice juice as well. However, the steak was really bad and dry. I asked for medium rare but came well done. Food was cold when it came! Literally cold steak and pork. Service was very slow but I saw that they have a ton of service crew?!?! The person who took my order ask if I want to have my dessert served later, but when I wanted to have the dessert, they told me i didnt order any. Probably will only come back and order a dri k for the ambience.",

Love that the outdoor dining area is dog friendly. The service staff was very friendly to my dog and served her water even though she barked at him (sorry!  ). Overall an amazing place for casual dining, would highly recommend!",

Thankful for the great weather and sitting outdoors was so chill and ambiance was lovely. Went there to celebrate my fathers birthday and staff prepared a slice of yummy red velvet cake that had a surprising peanut butter twist! The sparkling wine was great too, highly recommend it. My family had so much fun. Thank you, Ram, for the service! And also the other young Indian gentleman who was so conscientious about keeping our waters filled. We went on 12 Mar. P.s. the call button at each table is very helpful, all places should have them.",

Not the first time I have been here; and I like the closeness to nature and the fact it s actually just 15 mins leisurely walk away from the closest bus stop (don t believe if its says its less than 10) Sit outside if the weather is not too hot and windy. On certain nights they have the BBQ option - we tasted a few BBQ dishes from the menu and it was pretty decent. If you have a group of friends, my tip is to get a few starters/ appetizers, get a few BBQ dishes and share them all. The beef angus steak is pretty good, the grilled peppers were my favorite and the grilled octopus was pretty fantastic! For the drinks, beside the beer - the Mexican-type sangria (sorry I forgot the name) is my favorite. Price is a bit on the high side - the grilled vegetable is quite a small portion with main dish prices.",

On my dish that had 3 components, came only with 2.. Was chaos! Only 2 tables were being well served, probably related to owner.. all the rest was very upset. They claimed to have a bday desert, that we never got. By end of dinner, we just wanted to leave this place!

However, it seems the service is getting progressively worse each time we visit. I booked yesterday for mothers Day. In the morning, they called to confirm the reservation, and I specified we wanted an outdoor table. That evening, after ordering, they suddenly told us that we had to move indoors due to a wedding. (Didnt they know about the wedding when they called me that morning?) Aside from that, they are VERY slow. It took 30 minutes and 3 reminders for my son to get a drink. Staff all seem to be confused and not know what they are doing. All in all, a very strange mothers Day experience. We ended up just having drinks and not bothering to stay for dinner at all.",

                        "review_text": "Absolutely shocked at seeing how high the average ratings are - which goes to show that you cant trust averages. It was the most abysmal Restaurant Week (actually scratch that, any restaurant encounter) experience - and the fact that I chose it for one of my rare nights out with my SO drove me to write this even this has happened weeks ago! CONS 1) Servicing was almost non-existent: When we were seated, one of the lead waiters (?, Judging by the outfit) expected us to decide what to order from the e-menu mere minutes after being seated. We needed time and indicated so. It took us so long after go get the attention of anyone who would take our order. This was going to be a recurring pattern throughout the night - as we often had to ask and ask again to check where our drinks were (our order of a can of Coke took much longer to arrive than our appetizer), I think I also asked for my bill three times - the last time I just walked straight up to the front. The lead waiter that did take our order didnt really seem interested in making recommendations. Despite us ordering from the RW menu, he recommended the exact appetizer that was already in the RW menu. When I asked if they served ribs, he must have also forgotten that it was in the special menu until I saw it minutes after placing my order. The table next to us that was having a birthday party seemed to get more attention than us, so maybe we werent too interesting for the lead waiter? Who knows 2) Food was average to poor, for the price that was being charged. Forget about plating/ food presentation because there was no effort in that department. The place labels itself as a Spanish joint, but that was probably overstating: Everything was forgettable and mostly bland tasting, with the exception of the deep fried croquette balls and something else with Roquefort cheese (sorry, the experience was so bad I didnt even want to remember the details). The beef cheek was OK and the ribs were horribly bland. The dessert was forgettable. Cocktails were diluted and took forever (see comment above) to arrive. Perhaps it isnt fair to comment on presentation, but I was coming here with the mindset that it was part of RW. The appetizer, while delicious, was literally placed in a plate of lettuce and cheese that any kid could have done in 5 mins. PROS: The ambience. Long story short: Come for the ambience, but dont expect decent servicing or even decent food despite the prices that theyre charging.",

Similar for the carabinero prawns. I d come back for drinks and perhaps other dishes but you re better off steering clear of the calamari and prawns. But setting was very pleasant and staff serving us was especially cheery.",

Was pouring heavily and stuck at the roadside under a parasol, then came a waitress who carried umbrellas down the stairs to pass it to us. Chicken wings was crisp, steak was tender and the truffle brie pizza was flavorful. Would recommend the truffle pizza over the burrata pizza as the latter didt taste out of the ordinary. Portion given was more than enough too. Ambiance was great and service was very attentive, did not even need to ask for a refill of water as the waiters and waitresses are faster than me.

Its a bit disappointing that Txa is selling themselves as a Pintxo restaurant but the Pintxo section is only a small subset of their whole menu (only 7 Pintxo items). I was expecting more. Its also a bit odd that they serve burgers, pasta and pizza (we didnt try these). I see the pdf menu file says Reduced - hopefully they can bring the original menu as intended. The restaurants vibe is a bit odd as well and it did not say Pintxos restaurant. Maybe im nitpicking but even the music is a bit out of place - party/club music. The bar in the middle of the restaurant was also out of place. I guess the intention was to have the spread of Pintxos on the bar but given COVID situation, its not really ideal to have it there. Service was ok. We didnt experience any delays on the food. It was just unfortunate that the servers dropped and broke a lot of things (e.g. plates, cups) that day.",

The service was the real highlight of the evening, really enjoyed the hospitable service provided by the two young staff that mainly attended to us, unfortunately I only could get the name of one of them, Geri. She was really attentive and highly energetic, it made me feel like she genuinely enjoyed her work and I felt very comfortable. The manager also provided us with a free cheesecake for my girlfriend s birthday and that was greatly appreciated. Would definitely come again!",

The waiter attending to us mentioned he is from the restaurant UNA upstairs and he was just helping out at TXA. He claimed doesn t know the menu at TXA hence he was unable to answer our queries. We were hoping he would direct his colleague who knows the menu to us but all we got was a blank stare and an awkward silence. So awkward that we decided not to pursue it, give the benefit of the doubt and just order the food. (Food turned out so so, average) The food we ordered was meant for sharing and every time a stack of plates with cutlery were placed on our table. Not once did any staff took the initiative to lay the plates and cutlery out for us, it was always just a stack laid out at the corner of the table. The table was very unstable as well. It is hard to enjoy a meal while trying to balance the table and hope nothing falls off. Unless the management works on staff training and investing in sturdier dining tables for patrons, not worth a visit there.",

As our staff were engaged with other tables, a staff member from UNA s team noticed your table and attended to you in the meantime. We sincerely apologise that he was not able to provide menu recommendations due to his designation at UNA. Additionally, we hope that your dining experience was made a little better after our staff replaced the shaky table. Please rest assured that we have conveyed your feedback to our team and once again, we would like to extend our sincere regret that we were unable to provide you the best possible experience at TXA. We truly hope to have the opportunity to provide you a better experience next time should you choose to dine with us again. Cheers, TXA",

Drinks - All of us had preferences on our drinks and the bartenders personally attended to us and made excellent drinks. The 2 cocktails I had here were better than some of the best cocktail bars in Singapore. Food - We had the Chicken wings , Mushroom Croquettes and Truffle pizza. All dishes were great. Service - 10/10 for service. Right from when we arrived to the time we left we felt fully taken care of. Ambience is the best highlight. This is also a pet friendly place and my puppy loved being here. Will come by again. Thanks for a great evening.",

The atmosphere was really good, nice music in the background, temperature was just right even for outdoor, with a little breeze now and then. We had a few tapas and bar snacks to start with. Love the presentation of each dish. Honey paprika wings were the unexpected highlight!! Full of umami flavors from roasted sesame & seaweed. Finger licking good We were also impressed by the beef short rib dish, having literally melt-in-your-mouth kind of texture, going so well with the dipping sauce on the side. I would recommend to go with truffle mushroom for the pizza, forget the prawn & scallop as it was quite bland.. at least the truffle cream was satisfying with every bite. Overall, a very nice & cosy place for family & friends gathering, even a romantic date would be appropriate. Price wise, not cheap but reasonable I would say! Not forgetting to mention, their service crews were really well trained. Thumbs up.",

It felt like the floor crew did not communicate with one another. Food was first served without any cutleries as well. But the food was delicious so it made up for the lack in service. Then Ram (I hope I got his name right) started serving us and he completely changed the service game thereon. He was attentive, friendly, and patient. If it was not for him, we would not have left the place feeling like we had a good time. Thanks Ram!",

Great ambiance too, due to nicely set up lighting. Food was very good although in itself nothing to rave about. Good selection of pintxos and other small dishes as well as bigger mains. Nicely done and presented. Staff nice, attentive and flexible. Was sometimes hard to grab their attention as the space is quite big and we were sat at the end of the terrace, which meant that we had to keep trying, but when they did see us they were great.",

We asked her if they are selling cigarettes at the restaurant and they said didn t sell, then unexpectedly she offered her own cigarette to us.

We had sauteed mushroom with sous vide egg (recommended!), grilled padron peppers & paprika chicken wings. The happy hour drinks at 2 for 1 was a good deal. The burnt cheesecake was good though it was more of a soft cotton texture rather than gooey center. Churros was crunchy outside and fluffy inside. Mains were all good value below $30. Overall, very pleasant outdoors, with big fan and distance from other tables. Will visit again.",

                        "review_text": "Regrettable choice, with extremely dissatisfying service, small selection of average quality food. Ive planned to attend the Semana Grande event and to catch up with a few friends and to celebrate one of my friends birthday last night but it was so bad I actually felt ashamed to have celebrated my friends birthday there last night. The service was terrible starting from the moment we sat down, as the compound was quite big we had no clue where our table was and the hostess told us to go look for our friends ourselves who were already in the courtyard. One seated no one came to welcome us, if anything I felt quite unwelcome already by then. Then, we had to desperately get the attention of our service staff whom we later found out was called Ram (While leaving we asked him for his name and actually was trying to hide his name and asked us if we were looking for his manager instead). We decided to take a start off our night with some beers and Ram came to take the order but actually sniggered at us when he left with our order of 3 half pints of beer. I mean that was just uncalled for, but I decided to let it pass since i thought i might have heard wrong but later on in the evening it just got worse each time we made subsequent orders of pintxos, mains and beers , he would leave shaking his head in disappointment as though we were not ordering enough. What made me decide to write this review was that after we have paid for our bill and asked Ram for a refill of our glasses of water, he told us alright but actually went to the open bar and signalled to his colleague to not fill our glasses up. A quick look at some of the recent reviews claims that Rams service was immaculate and perfect which i couldnt help but wonder if Ram is capable of such great service then why were we treated in such a manner that makes us feel like we were discriminated. The other service staff were also very disorganised and Im sure it had nothing to do with being short staffed as the courtyard was barely full. When we placed our orders with other staff they would get Ram to come and re-confirm our orders and yet they would serve us dishes which we did not order (which was later included in our bill). We also experienced extremely varied waiting times for our food and beverages, we could be served almost instantly or have to wait for upwards of 15 minutes for some dishes. It almost felt like we could not dine in peace, let alone celebrate our friends birthday. The saving grace was when we spoke to one of their event staff about how terrible the service was considering it was an event + our friends birthday she proposed to give us a small discount at the end of the night. The food was a hit and miss, the mains were alright but considering it is a pintxo bar, which I would believe is the main point of going there, the pintxo selection was ridiculously small with only 5 options available. Prices are on the high side for what its worth. Im guessing theres much work to be done for this establishment and until then I will not advise anyone to dine there nor dine there personally.",

Not sure if it s because of  mass produce  since this is restaurant week menu, the pintxos aren t fresh. Breads taste stale. Beef is  hard to bite . And the waiters while friendly, are unattentive. Eg bringing in the birthday cake while half of the table went to washroom, and unable to answer simple questions on the drinks. I think the servers are just overwhelmed. There are lots of room for improvement both food and service wise. Sadly for now, I don t think I ll recommend my friends nor revisit anytime soon.",

                        "review_text": "The worst dinner I ve ever had in Singapore fell on Valentines day. Our table was booked for 8:30 pm. We reached around 8:20 pm and saw numerous couples standing around, waiting for a seat like a hawker center. We waited for more than half an hour standing since the waiting area was packed, and there were not enough seats. Everyone had to try their best entertaining each other because it is a special day otherwise I would not be surprised if someone started a riot. It was obvious that the issue was the restaurant being severely understaffed. There was only one person at the counter and another running around, directing people to their seats. Very disorganized. There was no queue number or any sort of queue to begin with. People could only stand around and pray to all the gods that they would be called next because no one had any clue who came first. After observing the whole situation, we decided to stay near the counter instead of walking outside to avoid the crowd. Luckily, we were randomly asked to go in after 30 mins of wating. I wonder those poor souls who waited further away from the counter (understandably since it was very crowded) probably had to wait longer. The menu was a standard Valentines menu, we only had one choice to make - main course. But I guess they thought we needed half an hour to decide or nobody seemed to care if we had ordered or not. After awkwardly trying to get attention from multiple staff, someone finally decided to take our order. It took 30 mins for the appetiser to come. The portion was very small - it took us more time to instagram it than eat it. Saving grace is, it tasted decent. 10 mins later our cocktails came but from there everything went from bad to worse. Throughout the time in there, staff were constantly asking what did we order for main course. Not sure they trying to save the earth by not writing it down or what. There are only two freaking options for mains. That means, for each table, you only need to remember two dishes. Pretty sure zi char uncles and aunties can definitely do a better job than this, think they should be hired instead. 10:00 pm we were starving already so we were contemplating about ordering grab food but don t wanna be too disrespectful so we asked how long more. 4 - 5 mins, that was the answer. 10:15 pm we realised by now that our innocent souls got tricked. Such a stupid thing to do. If we ordered McDonald s we might have a better Valentines dinner by now. Never mind that 5 minutes later, another staff came in, we were expecting a good news but it turned out:  what main course did you order ah? . Seriously? At first I thought my dinner was tragedy but it was a comedy. It just became funny at this point. I started questioning about life and suffering. I heard life is nothing by false hope and liars, I guess that s true. 10:23 pm we finally got our main. TWO HOURS after we reached here. And we spent 2 mins finishing that miserable little steak jajajjajahahahhaha. 10:32 pm the dessert was unfashionably fast to be served judging from their standard. Probably their new record timing here. 10:40pm we left the place hungry and disappointed. Proceeded to my gf house for a maggi mee. That s probably the best thing that night. Thank you TXA for making me realised that true joy doesn t need to be as expensive as your dinner menu. Just one humble suggestion, if you don t have enough staff, please don t ruin people s special day by operating at this substandard. You don t need to pay me for this suggestion, because you probably paid it with your brand reputation.",

We made a reservation for 8:30pm, and showed up at 8:45pm and sat at around 8:50pm. From there, I felt like I had entered a parallel universe where everything that could go wrong did. The whole operation was amiss. The staff especially had no idea what was going on. We waited 1.5 hours to get our food, at which point we suddenly got all our courses at the same time. This is where I m adding 2 additional stars for the very nice bottle of wine they comped us, since at this point we were one of the last tables remaining and still hadn t gotten our food. But I m subtracting 1 because, in a turn of events, they chased us down as we were leaving to ask us to pay. I feel incredibly sorry for the significant others who went out of their way to book and prepay this 3 course dinner. And even more sorry for anyone on their first date. In sum, I would probably advise you to do your due diligence before coming and consider avoiding for special occasions.",

It was clear that both teams were extremely unprepared. Next, a waiter came around asking how we would like our beef to be cooked (we had a choice between beef and fish). I was utterly shocked. Isn t the staff supposed to ask if we want fish or beef first? So rude and ill trained. Waited for more than an HOUR for the first course to arrive. Even then, the staff were extremely unsure on who they had already served and they comically tried to give the same table 2 servings. Embarrassing to say the least. Paid huge amounts of money for this dinner and it wasn t worth it at all. Drinks were bad, food was average, service was even worse. Will never come back ever again.",

Very polite person spoke to me on the phone but just said they were sorry and essentially blamed me. I know that I never called to cancel or cancelled through Chope on my phone. At minimum, really poor communication and no attempt to value a customer s reservations made online. They took the easy route, cancelled our place without actually talking to me, all for the sake of getting another customer. Felt greedy and transactional. We won t bring our business here.",

The complimentary nachos and cheese are Latin American in origin, not Spanish. The Estrella beer keg must ve been old as it had gone sour. For some bizarre reason, despite hand picking the cold pinxto dishes buffet style, guests are not allowed to bring it back to the table with us, but instead entrust the sever to ferry it. Was it to add on plating garnish? No. There is simply no logical explanation for this process. Additionally, this adds an opportunity for mistake for the evidently inexperienced staff to bring it to another table while we, who had arrived earlier, sat at a table devoid of our both our drinks and food orders as well as plates and cutlery. The grilled dishes came out before the cold which were lukewarm and sans char/grill marks. The dishes were both saturated with sweetness, devoid of the acidity and freshness characteristic to Spanish food. The octopus, concurring with an earlier review, tasted like bakwa. Finally, 2 out of 4 of our cold pinxto arrived 45mins after we originally picked it out at the counter and they were certainly not worth the wait. A big ball of soft cheese on a piece of toast is unpleasant by all accounts. Out of patience, we asked for the bill and left, feeling disgruntled and cheated at paying $170 for such a horrendous dining experience. Although the staff repeatedly apologized for the delay in getting us the cold pinxto, with so many service errors, it s an empty gesture that felt almost insulting to clearly unhappy customers. Professional restaurants would send a manager to make amends and ask for feedback on how to improve. Instead, the staff timidly avoided our table unless directly beckoned. You can t get me to go back even if you paid me. Edit: Management response on valid bad Google reviews continue to follow a common trend: giving flimsy excuses without fully understanding the situation since they never bothered to get more information from the client and exhibiting a deflection of responsibility.",

The service seems confused even though the place is mostly empty. Our appetizers were served to the wrong table even though there were only 4 tables. We had to wait 30 min to get ours and just canceled the last 2. The Estrella beer on tap was skunky, meaning the keg is getting old.  The octopus wasn t cooked properly. And to make things worse they served tortilla chips with bottled nacho cheese as a free appetizer. This place is a disgrace to Spanish food.",

More effort and thought could have been put into the plating. With an almost 2cm thick pork collar, there was also servings of thick round fries, and purely butterhead with what seems like thousand island dressing, made the whole thing looks very unappetizing. The salad here was just solely huge butterhead leaves with dressing, and that was it. Disappointing. Pisco sour was also not consistent. Ordered the first one and it was good, and so we ordered a second one. This was absolutely disappointing because there was barely the taste of the liquor, but just simple syrup. Towards the end, can smell the bad smell of egg white. The only reason why I gave two stars was because this place was the place we had our wedding lunch years back.",

The food was so-so, but Im mainly taking off points because of the poor service (the management needs to take note of how severely understaffed they are, and buck up on training their servers who are not familiar with the menu at all). The price point isnt great either - we spent about $250 for three including a bottle of wine - but Ive had way better Spanish food elsewhere. We waited very long for the tapas too. They forgot our churros and to their credit, waived the charge for that. I believe it can be improved if they train their staff and improve operations, but with all these factors taken together, I wont be coming back unless something drastic happens.",
